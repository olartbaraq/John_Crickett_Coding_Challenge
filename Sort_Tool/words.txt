When
Lionel
Giles
began
his
translation
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
Art
of
War
the
work
was
virtually
unknown
in
Europe
Its
introduction
to
Europe
began
in
when
a
French
Jesuit
Father
living
in
China
Joseph
Amiot
acquired
a
copy
of
it
and
translated
it
into
French
It
was
not
a
good
translation
because
according
to
Dr
Giles
I
t
contains
a
great
deal
that
Sun
Tzŭ
did
not
write
and
very
little
indeed
of
what
he
did
The
first
translation
into
English
was
published
in
in
Tokyo
by
Capt
E
F
Calthrop
R
F
A
However
this
translation
is
in
the
words
of
Dr
Giles
excessively
bad
He
goes
further
in
this
criticism
It
is
not
merely
a
question
of
downright
blunders
from
which
none
can
hope
to
be
wholly
exempt
Omissions
were
frequent
hard
passages
were
willfully
distorted
or
slurred
over
Such
offenses
are
less
pardonable
They
would
not
be
tolerated
in
any
edition
of
a
Latin
or
Greek
classic
and
a
similar
standard
of
honesty
ought
to
be
insisted
upon
in
translations
from
Chinese
In
a
new
edition
of
Capt
Calthrop
s
translation
was
published
in
London
It
was
an
improvement
on
the
first
omissions
filled
up
and
numerous
mistakes
corrected
but
new
errors
were
created
in
the
process
Dr
Giles
in
justifying
his
translation
wrote
It
was
not
undertaken
out
of
any
inflated
estimate
of
my
own
powers
but
I
could
not
help
feeling
that
Sun
Tzŭ
deserved
a
better
fate
than
had
befallen
him
and
I
knew
that
at
any
rate
I
could
hardly
fail
to
improve
on
the
work
of
my
predecessors
Clearly
Dr
Giles
work
established
much
of
the
groundwork
for
the
work
of
later
translators
who
published
their
own
editions
Of
the
later
editions
of
the
Art
of
War
I
have
examined
two
feature
Giles
edited
translation
and
notes
the
other
two
present
the
same
basic
information
from
the
ancient
Chinese
commentators
found
in
the
Giles
edition
Of
these
four
Giles
edition
is
the
most
scholarly
and
presents
the
reader
an
incredible
amount
of
information
concerning
Sun
Tzŭ
s
text
much
more
than
any
other
translation
The
Giles
edition
of
the
Art
of
War
as
stated
above
was
a
scholarly
work
Dr
Giles
was
a
leading
sinologue
at
the
time
and
an
assistant
in
the
Department
of
Oriental
Printed
Books
and
Manuscripts
in
the
British
Museum
Apparently
he
wanted
to
produce
a
definitive
edition
superior
to
anything
else
that
existed
and
perhaps
something
that
would
become
a
standard
translation
It
was
the
best
translation
available
for
years
But
apparently
there
was
not
much
interest
in
Sun
Tzŭ
in
English
speaking
countries
since
it
took
the
start
of
the
Second
World
War
to
renew
interest
in
his
work
Several
people
published
unsatisfactory
English
translations
of
Sun
Tzŭ
In
Dr
Giles
translation
was
edited
and
published
in
the
United
States
in
a
series
of
military
science
books
But
it
wasn
t
until
that
a
good
English
translation
by
Samuel
B
Griffith
and
still
in
print
was
published
that
was
an
equal
to
Giles
translation
While
this
translation
is
more
lucid
than
Dr
Giles
translation
it
lacks
his
copious
notes
that
make
his
so
interesting
Dr
Giles
produced
a
work
primarily
intended
for
scholars
of
the
Chinese
civilization
and
language
It
contains
the
Chinese
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
the
English
translation
and
voluminous
notes
along
with
numerous
footnotes
Unfortunately
some
of
his
notes
and
footnotes
contain
Chinese
characters
some
are
completely
Chinese
Thus
a
conversion
to
a
Latin
alphabet
etext
was
difficult
I
did
the
conversion
in
complete
ignorance
of
Chinese
except
for
what
I
learned
while
doing
the
conversion
Thus
I
faced
the
difficult
task
of
paraphrasing
it
while
retaining
as
much
of
the
important
text
as
I
could
Every
paraphrase
represents
a
loss
thus
I
did
what
I
could
to
retain
as
much
of
the
text
as
possible
Because
the
text
contains
a
Chinese
concordance
I
was
able
to
transliterate
proper
names
books
and
the
like
at
the
risk
of
making
the
text
more
obscure
However
the
text
on
the
whole
is
quite
satisfactory
for
the
casual
reader
a
transformation
made
possible
by
conversion
to
an
etext
However
I
come
away
from
this
task
with
the
feeling
of
loss
because
I
know
that
someone
with
a
background
in
Chinese
can
do
a
better
job
than
I
did
any
such
attempt
would
be
welcomed

Preface
by
Lionel
Giles
The
seventh
volume
of
Mémoires
concernant
l
histoire
les
sciences
les
arts
les
mœurs
les
usages
c
des
Chinois
is
devoted
to
the
Art

and
contains
amongst
other
treatises
Les

translated
from
the
Chinese
by
a
Jesuit
Father
Joseph
Amiot
Père
Amiot
appears
to
have
enjoyed
no
small
reputation
as
a
sinologue
in
his
day
and
the
field
of
his
labours
was
certainly
extensive
But
his
so
called
translation
of
the
Sun
Tzŭ
if
placed
side
by
side
with
the
original
is
seen
at
once
to
be
little
better
than
an
imposture
It
contains
a
great
deal
that
Sun
Tzŭ
did
not
write
and
very
little
indeed
of
what
he
did
Here
is
a
fair
specimen
taken
from
the
opening
sentences
of
chapter

Throughout
the
nineteenth
century
which
saw
a
wonderful
development
in
the
study
of
Chinese
literature
no
translator
ventured
to
tackle
Sun
Tzŭ
although
his
work
was
known
to
be
highly
valued
in
China
as
by
far
the
oldest
and
best
compendium
of
military
science
It
was
not
until
the
year
that
the
first
English
translation
by
Capt
E
F
Calthrop
R
F
A
appeared
at
Tokyo
under
the
title
Sonshi
the
Japanese
form
of
Sun
Tzŭ
Unfortunately
it
was
evident
that
the
translator
s
knowledge
of
Chinese
was
far
too
scanty
to
fit
him
to
grapple
with
the
manifold
difficulties
of
Sun
Tzŭ
He
himself
plainly
acknowledges
that
without
the
aid
of
two
Japanese
gentlemen
the
accompanying
translation
would
have
been
impossible
We
can
only
wonder
then
that
with
their
help
it
should
have
been
so
excessively
bad
It
is
not
merely
a
question
of
downright
blunders
from
which
none
can
hope
to
be
wholly
exempt
Omissions
were
frequent
hard
passages
were
wilfully
distorted
or
slurred
over
Such
offences
are
less
pardonable
They
would
not
be
tolerated
in
any
edition
of
a
Greek
or
Latin
classic
and
a
similar
standard
of
honesty
ought
to
be
insisted
upon
in
translations
from
Chinese
From
blemishes
of
this
nature
at
least
I
believe
that
the
present
translation
is
free
It
was
not
undertaken
out
of
any
inflated
estimate
of
my
own
powers
but
I
could
not
help
feeling
that
Sun
Tzŭ
deserved
a
better
fate
than
had
befallen
him
and
I
knew
that
at
any
rate
I
could
hardly
fail
to
improve
on
the
work
of
my
predecessors
Towards
the
end
of
a
new
and
revised
edition
of
Capt
Calthrop
s
translation
was
published
in
London
this
time
however
without
any
allusion
to
his
Japanese
collaborators
My
first
three
chapters
were
then
already
in
the
printer
s
hands
so
that
the
criticisms
of
Capt
Calthrop
therein
contained
must
be
understood
as
referring
to
his
earlier
edition
This
is
on
the
whole
an
improvement
on
the
other
thought
there
still
remains
much
that
cannot
pass
muster
Some
of
the
grosser
blunders
have
been
rectified
and
lacunae
filled
up
but
on
the
other
hand
a
certain
number
of
new
mistakes
appear
The
very
first
sentence
of
the
introduction
is
startlingly
inaccurate
and
later
on
while
mention
is
made
of
an
army
of
Japanese
commentators
on
Sun
Tzŭ
who
are
these
by
the
way
not
a
word
is
vouchsafed
about
the
Chinese
commentators
who
nevertheless
I
venture
to
assert
form
a
much
more
numerous
and
infinitely
more
important
army
A
few
special
features
of
the
present
volume
may
now
be
noticed
In
the
first
place
the
text
has
been
cut
up
into
numbered
paragraphs
both
in
order
to
facilitate
cross
reference
and
for
the
convenience
of
students
generally
The
division
follows
broadly
that
of
Sun
Hsing
yen
s
edition
but
I
have
sometimes
found
it
desirable
to
join
two
or
more
of
his
paragraphs
into
one
In
quoting
from
other
works
Chinese
writers
seldom
give
more
than
the
bare
title
by
way
of
reference
and
the
task
of
research
is
apt
to
be
seriously
hampered
in
consequence
With
a
view
to
obviating
this
difficulty
so
far
as
Sun
Tzŭ
is
concerned
I
have
also
appended
a
complete
concordance
of
Chinese
characters
following
in
this
the
admirable
example
of
Legge
though
an
alphabetical
arrangement
has
been
preferred
to
the
distribution
under
radicals
which
he
adopted
Another
feature
borrowed
from
The
Chinese
Classics
is
the
printing
of
text
translation
and
notes
on
the
same
page
the
notes
however
are
inserted
according
to
the
Chinese
method
immediately
after
the
passages
to
which
they
refer
From
the
mass
of
native
commentary
my
aim
has
been
to
extract
the
cream
only
adding
the
Chinese
text
here
and
there
when
it
seemed
to
present
points
of
literary
interest
Though
constituting
in
itself
an
important
branch
of
Chinese
literature
very
little
commentary
of
this
kind
has
hitherto
been
made
directly
accessible
by
translation
I
may
say
in
conclusion
that
owing
to
the
printing
off
of
my
sheets
as
they
were
completed
the
work
has
not
had
the
benefit
of
a
final
revision
On
a
review
of
the
whole
without
modifying
the
substance
of
my
criticisms
I
might
have
been
inclined
in
a
few
instances
to
temper
their
asperity
Having
chosen
to
wield
a
bludgeon
however
I
shall
not
cry
out
if
in
return
I
am
visited
with
more
than
a
rap
over
the
knuckles
Indeed
I
have
been
at
some
pains
to
put
a
sword
into
the
hands
of
future
opponents
by
scrupulously
giving
either
text
or
reference
for
every
passage
translated
A
scathing
review
even
from
the
pen
of
the
Shanghai
critic
who
despises
mere
translations
would
not
I
must
confess
be
altogether
unwelcome
For
after
all
the
worst
fate
I
shall
have
to
dread
is
that
which
befell
the
ingenious
paradoxes
of
George
in
The
Vicar
of
Wakefield
INTRODUCTION
Sun
Wu
and
his
Book
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
gives
the
following
biography
of
Sun
Tzŭ
Sun
Tzŭ
Wu
was
a
native
of
the
Ch
i
State
His
Art
of
War
brought
him
to
the
notice
of
Ho
Lu
King
of
Wu
Ho
Lu
said
to
him
I
have
carefully
perused
your
chapters
May
I
submit
your
theory
of
managing
soldiers
to
a
slight
test
Sun
Tzŭ
replied
You
may
Ho
Lu
asked
May
the
test
be
applied
to
women
The
answer
was
again
in
the
affirmative
so
arrangements
were
made
to
bring
ladies
out
of
the
Palace
Sun
Tzŭ
divided
them
into
two
companies
and
placed
one
of
the
King
s
favourite
concubines
at
the
head
of
each
He
then
bade
them
all
take
spears
in
their
hands
and
addressed
them
thus
I
presume
you
know
the
difference
between
front
and
back
right
hand
and
left
hand
The
girls
replied
Yes
Sun
Tzŭ
went
on
When
I
say
Eyes
front
you
must
look
straight
ahead
When
I
say
Left
turn
you
must
face
towards
your
left
hand
When
I
say
Right
turn
you
must
face
towards
your
right
hand
When
I
say
About
turn
you
must
face
right
round
towards
your
back
Again
the
girls
assented
The
words
of
command
having
been
thus
explained
he
set
up
the
halberds
and
battle
axes
in
order
to
begin
the
drill
Then
to
the
sound
of
drums
he
gave
the
order
Right
turn
But
the
girls
only
burst
out
laughing
Sun
Tzŭ
said
If
words
of
command
are
not
clear
and
distinct
if
orders
are
not
thoroughly
understood
then
the
general
is
to
blame
So
he
started
drilling
them
again
and
this
time
gave
the
order
Left
turn
whereupon
the
girls
once
more
burst
into
fits
of
laughter
Sun
Tzŭ
If
words
of
command
are
not
clear
and
distinct
if
orders
are
not
thoroughly
understood
the
general
is
to
blame
But
if
his
orders
are
clear
and
the
soldiers
nevertheless
disobey
then
it
is
the
fault
of
their
officers
So
saying
he
ordered
the
leaders
of
the
two
companies
to
be
beheaded
Now
the
king
of
Wu
was
watching
the
scene
from
the
top
of
a
raised
pavilion
and
when
he
saw
that
his
favourite
concubines
were
about
to
be
executed
he
was
greatly
alarmed
and
hurriedly
sent
down
the
following
message
We
are
now
quite
satisfied
as
to
our
general
s
ability
to
handle
troops
If
we
are
bereft
of
these
two
concubines
our
meat
and
drink
will
lose
their
savor
It
is
our
wish
that
they
shall
not
be
beheaded
Sun
Tzŭ
replied
Having
once
received
His
Majesty
s
commission
to
be
the
general
of
his
forces
there
are
certain
commands
of
His
Majesty
which
acting
in
that
capacity
I
am
unable
to
accept
Accordingly
he
had
the
two
leaders
beheaded
and
straightway
installed
the
pair
next
in
order
as
leaders
in
their
place
When
this
had
been
done
the
drum
was
sounded
for
the
drill
once
more
and
the
girls
went
through
all
the
evolutions
turning
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
marching
ahead
or
wheeling
back
kneeling
or
standing
with
perfect
accuracy
and
precision
not
venturing
to
utter
a
sound
Then
Sun
Tzŭ
sent
a
messenger
to
the
King
saying
Your
soldiers
Sire
are
now
properly
drilled
and
disciplined
and
ready
for
your
majesty
s
inspection
They
can
be
put
to
any
use
that
their
sovereign
may
desire
bid
them
go
through
fire
and
water
and
they
will
not
disobey
But
the
King
replied
Let
our
general
cease
drilling
and
return
to
camp
As
for
us
We
have
no
wish
to
come
down
and
inspect
the
troops
Thereupon
Sun
Tzŭ
said
The
King
is
only
fond
of
words
and
cannot
translate
them
into
deeds
After
that
Ho
Lu
saw
that
Sun
Tzŭ
was
one
who
knew
how
to
handle
an
army
and
finally
appointed
him
general
In
the
west
he
defeated
the
Ch
u
State
and
forced
his
way
into
Ying
the
capital
to
the
north
he
put
fear
into
the
States
of
Ch
i
and
Chin
and
spread
his
fame
abroad
amongst
the
feudal
princes
And
Sun
Tzŭ
shared
in
the
might
of
the
King
About
Sun
Tzŭ
himself
this
is
all
that
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
has
to
tell
us
in
this
chapter
But
he
proceeds
to
give
a
biography
of
his
descendant
Sun
Pin
born
about
a
hundred
years
after
his
famous
ancestor
s
death
and
also
the
outstanding
military
genius
of
his
time
The
historian
speaks
of
him
too
as
Sun
Tzŭ
and
in
his
preface
we
read
Sun
Tzŭ
had
his
feet
cut
off
and
yet
continued
to
discuss
the
art
of
war
It
seems
likely
then
that
Pin
was
a
nickname
bestowed
on
him
after
his
mutilation
unless
the
story
was
invented
in
order
to
account
for
the
name
The
crowning
incident
of
his
career
the
crushing
defeat
of
his
treacherous
rival
P
ang
Chuan
will
be
found
briefly
related
in
Chapter
V
note
To
return
to
the
elder
Sun
Tzŭ
He
is
mentioned
in
two
other
passages
of
the
Shih
Chi
In
the
third
year
of
his
reign
B
C
Ho
Lu
king
of
Wu
took
the
field
with
Tzŭ
hsu
i
e
Wu
Yuan
and
Po
P
ei
and
attacked
Ch
u
He
captured
the
town
of
Shu
and
slew
the
two
prince
s
sons
who
had
formerly
been
generals
of
Wu
He
was
then
meditating
a
descent
on
Ying
the
capital
but
the
general
Sun
Wu
said
The
army
is
exhausted
It
is
not
yet
possible
We
must
wait
After
further
successful
fighting
in
the
ninth
year
B
C
King
Ho
Lu
addressed
Wu
Tzŭ
hsu
and
Sun
Wu
saying
Formerly
you
declared
that
it
was
not
yet
possible
for
us
to
enter
Ying
Is
the
time
ripe
now
The
two
men
replied
Ch
u
s
general
Tzŭ
ch
ang
is
grasping
and
covetous
and
the
princes
of
T
ang
and
Ts
ai
both
have
a
grudge
against
him
If
Your
Majesty
has
resolved
to
make
a
grand
attack
you
must
win
over
T
ang
and
Ts
ai
and
then
you
may
succeed
Ho
Lu
followed
this
advice
beat
Ch
u
in
five
pitched
battles
and
marched
into
Ying
This
is
the
latest
date
at
which
anything
is
recorded
of
Sun
Wu
He
does
not
appear
to
have
survived
his
patron
who
died
from
the
effects
of
a
wound
in
In
another
chapter
there
occurs
this
passage
From
this
time
onward
a
number
of
famous
soldiers
arose
one
after
the
other
Kao
fan
who
was
employed
by
the
Chin
State
Wang
tzu
in
the
service
of
Ch
i
and
Sun
Wu
in
the
service
of
Wu
These
men
developed
and
threw
light
upon
the
principles
of
war
It
is
obvious
enough
that
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
at
least
had
no
doubt
about
the
reality
of
Sun
Wu
as
an
historical
personage
and
with
one
exception
to
be
noticed
presently
he
is
by
far
the
most
important
authority
on
the
period
in
question
It
will
not
be
necessary
therefore
to
say
much
of
such
a
work
as
the
Wu
Yüeh
Ch
un
Ch
iu
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
written
by
Chao
Yeh
of
the
century
A
D
The
attribution
is
somewhat
doubtful
but
even
if
it
were
otherwise
his
account
would
be
of
little
value
based
as
it
is
on
the
Shih
Chi
and
expanded
with
romantic
details
The
story
of
Sun
Tzŭ
will
be
found
for
what
it
is
worth
in
chapter
The
only
new
points
in
it
worth
noting
are
Sun
Tzŭ
was
first
recommended
to
Ho
Lu
by
Wu
Tzŭ
hsu
He
is
called
a
native
of
Wu
He
had
previously
lived
a
retired
life
and
his
contemporaries
were
unaware
of
his
ability
The
following
passage
occurs
in
the
Huai
nan
Tzŭ
When
sovereign
and
ministers
show
perversity
of
mind
it
is
impossible
even
for
a
Sun
Tzŭ
to
encounter
the
foe
Assuming
that
this
work
is
genuine
and
hitherto
no
doubt
has
been
cast
upon
it
we
have
here
the
earliest
direct
reference
for
Sun
Tzŭ
for
Huai
nan
Tzŭ
died
in
B
C
many
years
before
the
Shih
Chi
was
given
to
the
world
Liu
Hsiang
B
C
says
The
reason
why
Sun
Tzŭ
at
the
head
of
men
beat
Ch
u
with
is
that
the
latter
were
undisciplined
Teng
Ming
shih
informs
us
that
the
surname
Sun
was
bestowed
on
Sun
Wu
s
grandfather
by
Duke
Ching
of
Ch
i
B
C
Sun
Wu
s
father
Sun
P
ing
rose
to
be
a
Minister
of
State
in
Ch
i
and
Sun
Wu
himself
whose
style
was
Ch
ang
ch
ing
fled
to
Wu
on
account
of
the
rebellion
which
was
being
fomented
by
the
kindred
of
T
ien
Pao
He
had
three
sons
of
whom
the
second
named
Ming
was
the
father
of
Sun
Pin
According
to
this
account
then
Pin
was
the
grandson
of
Wu
which
considering
that
Sun
Pin
s
victory
over
Wei
was
gained
in
B
C
may
be
dismissed
as
chronologically
impossible
Whence
these
data
were
obtained
by
Teng
Ming
shih
I
do
not
know
but
of
course
no
reliance
whatever
can
be
placed
in
them
An
interesting
document
which
has
survived
from
the
close
of
the
Han
period
is
the
short
preface
written
by
the
Great
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
or
Wei
Wu
Ti
for
his
edition
of
Sun
Tzŭ
I
shall
give
it
in
full
I
have
heard
that
the
ancients
used
bows
and
arrows
to
their
advantage
The
Lun
Yu
says
There
must
be
a
sufficiency
of
military
strength
The
Shu
Ching
mentions
the
army
among
the
eight
objects
of
government
The
I
Ching
says
army
indicates
firmness
and
justice
the
experienced
leader
will
have
good
fortune
The
Shih
Ching
says
The
King
rose
majestic
in
his
wrath
and
he
marshalled
his
troops
The
Yellow
Emperor
T
ang
the
Completer
and
Wu
Wang
all
used
spears
and
battle
axes
in
order
to
succour
their
generation
The
Ssu
ma
Fa
says
If
one
man
slay
another
of
set
purpose
he
himself
may
rightfully
be
slain
He
who
relies
solely
on
warlike
measures
shall
be
exterminated
he
who
relies
solely
on
peaceful
measures
shall
perish
Instances
of
this
are
Fu
Ch
ai
on
the
one
hand
and
Yen
Wang
on
the
other
In
military
matters
the
Sage
s
rule
is
normally
to
keep
the
peace
and
to
move
his
forces
only
when
occasion
requires
He
will
not
use
armed
force
unless
driven
to
it
by
necessity
Many
books
have
I
read
on
the
subject
of
war
and
fighting
but
the
work
composed
by
Sun
Wu
is
the
profoundest
of
them
all
Sun
Tzŭ
was
a
native
of
the
Ch
i
state
his
personal
name
was
Wu
He
wrote
the
Art
of
War
in
chapters
for
Ho
Lu
King
of
Wu
Its
principles
were
tested
on
women
and
he
was
subsequently
made
a
general
He
led
an
army
westwards
crushed
the
Ch
u
state
and
entered
Ying
the
capital
In
the
north
he
kept
Ch
i
and
Chin
in
awe
A
hundred
years
and
more
after
his
time
Sun
Pin
lived
He
was
a
descendant
of
Wu
In
his
treatment
of
deliberation
and
planning
the
importance
of
rapidity
in
taking
the
field
clearness
of
conception
and
depth
of
design
Sun
Tzŭ
stands
beyond
the
reach
of
carping
criticism
My
contemporaries
however
have
failed
to
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
his
instructions
and
while
putting
into
practice
the
smaller
details
in
which
his
work
abounds
they
have
overlooked
its
essential
purport
That
is
the
motive
which
has
led
me
to
outline
a
rough
explanation
of
the
whole
One
thing
to
be
noticed
in
the
above
is
the
explicit
statement
that
the
chapters
were
specially
composed
for
King
Ho
Lu
This
is
supported
by
the
internal
evidence
of
I
in
which
it
seems
clear
that
some
ruler
is
addressed
In
the
bibliographic
section
of
the
Han
Shu
there
is
an
entry
which
has
given
rise
to
much
discussion
The
works
of
Sun
Tzŭ
of
Wu
in
p
ien
or
chapters
with
diagrams
in
chuan
It
is
evident
that
this
cannot
be
merely
the
chapters
known
to
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
or
those
we
possess
today
Chang
Shou
chieh
refers
to
an
edition
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
Art
of
War
of
which
the
chapters
formed
the
first
chuan
adding
that
there
were
two
other
chuan
besides
This
has
brought
forth
a
theory
that
the
bulk
of
these
chapters
consisted
of
other
writings
of
Sun
Tzŭ
we
should
call
them
apocryphal
similar
to
the
Wen
Ta
of
which
a
specimen
dealing
with
the
Nine
Situations
is
preserved
in
the
T
ung
Tien
and
another
in
Ho
Shin
s
commentary
It
is
suggested
that
before
his
interview
with
Ho
Lu
Sun
Tzŭ
had
only
written
the
chapters
but
afterwards
composed
a
sort
of
exegesis
in
the
form
of
question
and
answer
between
himself
and
the
King
Pi
I
hsun
the
author
of
the
Sun
Tzŭ
Hsu
Lu
backs
this
up
with
a
quotation
from
the
Wu
Yüeh
Ch
un
Ch
iu
The
King
of
Wu
summoned
Sun
Tzŭ
and
asked
him
questions
about
the
art
of
war
Each
time
he
set
forth
a
chapter
of
his
work
the
King
could
not
find
words
enough
to
praise
him
As
he
points
out
if
the
whole
work
was
expounded
on
the
same
scale
as
in
the
above
mentioned
fragments
the
total
number
of
chapters
could
not
fail
to
be
considerable
Then
the
numerous
other
treatises
attributed
to
Sun
Tzŭ
might
be
included
The
fact
that
the
Han
Chih
mentions
no
work
of
Sun
Tzŭ
except
the
p
ien
whereas
the
Sui
and
T
ang
bibliographies
give
the
titles
of
others
in
addition
to
the
chapters
is
good
proof
Pi
I
hsun
thinks
that
all
of
these
were
contained
in
the
p
ien
Without
pinning
our
faith
to
the
accuracy
of
details
supplied
by
the
Wu
Yüeh
Ch
un
Ch
iu
or
admitting
the
genuineness
of
any
of
the
treatises
cited
by
Pi
I
hsun
we
may
see
in
this
theory
a
probable
solution
of
the
mystery
Between
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
and
Pan
Ku
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
a
luxuriant
crop
of
forgeries
to
have
grown
up
under
the
magic
name
of
Sun
Tzŭ
and
the
p
ien
may
very
well
represent
a
collected
edition
of
these
lumped
together
with
the
original
work
It
is
also
possible
though
less
likely
that
some
of
them
existed
in
the
time
of
the
earlier
historian
and
were
purposely
ignored
by
him
Tu
Mu
s
conjecture
seems
to
be
based
on
a
passage
which
states
Wei
Wu
Ti
strung
together
Sun
Wu
s
Art
of
War
which
in
turn
may
have
resulted
from
a
misunderstanding
of
the
final
words
of
Ts
ao
King
s
preface
This
as
Sun
Hsing
yen
points
out
is
only
a
modest
way
of
saying
that
he
made
an
explanatory
paraphrase
or
in
other
words
wrote
a
commentary
on
it
On
the
whole
this
theory
has
met
with
very
little
acceptance
Thus
the
Ssu
K
u
Ch
uan
Shu
says
The
mention
of
the
chapters
in
the
Shih
Chi
shows
that
they
were
in
existence
before
the
Han
Chih
and
that
latter
accretions
are
not
to
be
considered
part
of
the
original
work
Tu
Mu
s
assertion
can
certainly
not
be
taken
as
proof
There
is
every
reason
to
suppose
then
that
the
chapters
existed
in
the
time
of
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
practically
as
we
have
them
now
That
the
work
was
then
well
known
he
tells
us
in
so
many
words
Sun
Tzŭ
s
Chapters
and
Wu
Ch
i
s
Art
of
War
are
the
two
books
that
people
commonly
refer
to
on
the
subject
of
military
matters
Both
of
them
are
widely
distributed
so
I
will
not
discuss
them
here
But
as
we
go
further
back
serious
difficulties
begin
to
arise
The
salient
fact
which
has
to
be
faced
is
that
the
Tso
Chuan
the
greatest
contemporary
record
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
Sun
Wu
either
as
a
general
or
as
a
writer
It
is
natural
in
view
of
this
awkward
circumstance
that
many
scholars
should
not
only
cast
doubt
on
the
story
of
Sun
Wu
as
given
in
the
Shih
Chi
but
even
show
themselves
frankly
skeptical
as
to
the
existence
of
the
man
at
all
The
most
powerful
presentment
of
this
side
of
the
case
is
to
be
found
in
the
following
disposition
by
Yeh
Shui
hsin
It
is
stated
in
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
s
history
that
Sun
Wu
was
a
native
of
the
Ch
i
State
and
employed
by
Wu
and
that
in
the
reign
of
Ho
Lu
he
crushed
Ch
u
entered
Ying
and
was
a
great
general
But
in
Tso
s
Commentary
no
Sun
Wu
appears
at
all
It
is
true
that
Tso
s
Commentary
need
not
contain
absolutely
everything
that
other
histories
contain
But
Tso
has
not
omitted
to
mention
vulgar
plebeians
and
hireling
ruffians
such
as
Ying
K
ao
shu
Ts
ao
Kuei
Chu
Chih
wu
and
Chuan
She
chu
In
the
case
of
Sun
Wu
whose
fame
and
achievements
were
so
brilliant
the
omission
is
much
more
glaring
Again
details
are
given
in
their
due
order
about
his
contemporaries
Wu
Yuan
and
the
Minister
P
ei
Is
it
credible
that
Sun
Wu
alone
should
have
been
passed
over
In
point
of
literary
style
Sun
Tzŭ
s
work
belongs
to
the
same
school
as
Kuan
Tzŭ
Liu
T
ao
and
the
Yüeh
Yu
and
may
have
been
the
production
of
some
private
scholar
living
towards
the
end
of
the
Spring
and
Autumn
or
the
beginning
of
the
Warring
States
period
The
story
that
his
precepts
were
actually
applied
by
the
Wu
State
is
merely
the
outcome
of
big
talk
on
the
part
of
his
followers
From
the
flourishing
period
of
the
Chou
dynasty
down
to
the
time
of
the
Spring
and
Autumn
all
military
commanders
were
statesmen
as
well
and
the
class
of
professional
generals
for
conducting
external
campaigns
did
not
then
exist
It
was
not
until
the
period
of
the
Six
States
that
this
custom
changed
Now
although
Wu
was
an
uncivilized
State
it
is
conceivable
that
Tso
should
have
left
unrecorded
the
fact
that
Sun
Wu
was
a
great
general
and
yet
held
no
civil
office
What
we
are
told
therefore
about
Jang
chu
and
Sun
Wu
is
not
authentic
matter
but
the
reckless
fabrication
of
theorizing
pundits
The
story
of
Ho
Lu
s
experiment
on
the
women
in
particular
is
utterly
preposterous
and
incredible
Yeh
Shui
hsin
represents
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
as
having
said
that
Sun
Wu
crushed
Ch
u
and
entered
Ying
This
is
not
quite
correct
No
doubt
the
impression
left
on
the
reader
s
mind
is
that
he
at
least
shared
in
these
exploits
The
fact
may
or
may
not
be
significant
but
it
is
nowhere
explicitly
stated
in
the
Shih
Chi
either
that
Sun
Tzŭ
was
general
on
the
occasion
of
the
taking
of
Ying
or
that
he
even
went
there
at
all
Moreover
as
we
know
that
Wu
Yuan
and
Po
P
ei
both
took
part
in
the
expedition
and
also
that
its
success
was
largely
due
to
the
dash
and
enterprise
of
Fu
Kai
Ho
Lu
s
younger
brother
it
is
not
easy
to
see
how
yet
another
general
could
have
played
a
very
prominent
part
in
the
same
campaign
Ch
en
Chen
sun
of
the
Sung
dynasty
has
the
note
Military
writers
look
upon
Sun
Wu
as
the
father
of
their
art
But
the
fact
that
he
does
not
appear
in
the
Tso
Chuan
although
he
is
said
to
have
served
under
Ho
Lu
King
of
Wu
makes
it
uncertain
what
period
he
really
belonged
to
He
also
says
The
works
of
Sun
Wu
and
Wu
Ch
i
may
be
of
genuine
antiquity
It
is
noticeable
that
both
Yeh
Shui
hsin
and
Ch
en
Chen
sun
while
rejecting
the
personality
of
Sun
Wu
as
he
figures
in
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
s
history
are
inclined
to
accept
the
date
traditionally
assigned
to
the
work
which
passes
under
his
name
The
author
of
the
Hsu
Lu
fails
to
appreciate
this
distinction
and
consequently
his
bitter
attack
on
Ch
en
Chen
sun
really
misses
its
mark
He
makes
one
of
two
points
however
which
certainly
tell
in
favour
of
the
high
antiquity
of
our
chapters
Sun
Tzŭ
he
says
must
have
lived
in
the
age
of
Ching
Wang
because
he
is
frequently
plagiarized
in
subsequent
works
of
the
Chou
Ch
in
and
Han
dynasties
The
two
most
shameless
offenders
in
this
respect
are
Wu
Ch
i
and
Huai
nan
Tzŭ
both
of
them
important
historical
personages
in
their
day
The
former
lived
only
a
century
after
the
alleged
date
of
Sun
Tzŭ
and
his
death
is
known
to
have
taken
place
in
B
C
It
was
to
him
according
to
Liu
Hsiang
that
Tseng
Shen
delivered
the
Tso
Chuan
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
by
its
author
Now
the
fact
that
quotations
from
the
Art
of
War
acknowledged
or
otherwise
are
to
be
found
in
so
many
authors
of
different
epochs
establishes
a
very
strong
anterior
to
them
all
in
other
words
that
Sun
Tzŭ
s
treatise
was
already
in
existence
towards
the
end
of
the
century
B
C
Further
proof
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
antiquity
is
furnished
by
the
archaic
or
wholly
obsolete
meanings
attaching
to
a
number
of
the
words
he
uses
A
list
of
these
which
might
perhaps
be
extended
is
given
in
the
Hsu
Lu
and
though
some
of
the
interpretations
are
doubtful
the
main
argument
is
hardly
affected
thereby
Again
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
Yeh
Shui
hsin
a
scholar
and
critic
of
the
first
rank
deliberately
pronounces
the
style
of
the
chapters
to
belong
to
the
early
part
of
the
fifth
century
Seeing
that
he
is
actually
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
disprove
the
existence
of
Sun
Wu
himself
we
may
be
sure
that
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
assign
the
work
to
a
later
date
had
he
not
honestly
believed
the
contrary
And
it
is
precisely
on
such
a
point
that
the
judgment
of
an
educated
Chinaman
will
carry
most
weight
Other
internal
evidence
is
not
far
to
seek
Thus
in
XIII
there
is
an
unmistakable
allusion
to
the
ancient
system
of
land
tenure
which
had
already
passed
away
by
the
time
of
Mencius
who
was
anxious
to
see
it
revived
in
a
modified
form
The
only
warfare
Sun
Tzŭ
knows
is
that
carried
on
between
the
various
feudal
princes
in
which
armored
chariots
play
a
large
part
Their
use
seems
to
have
entirely
died
out
before
the
end
of
the
Chou
dynasty
He
speaks
as
a
man
of
Wu
a
state
which
ceased
to
exist
as
early
as
B
C
On
this
I
shall
touch
presently
But
once
refer
the
work
to
the
century
or
earlier
and
the
chances
of
its
being
other
than
a
bonâ
fide
production
are
sensibly
diminished
The
great
age
of
forgeries
did
not
come
until
long
after
That
it
should
have
been
forged
in
the
period
immediately
following
is
particularly
unlikely
for
no
one
as
a
rule
hastens
to
identify
himself
with
a
lost
cause
As
for
Yeh
Shui
hsin
s
theory
that
the
author
was
a
literary
recluse
that
seems
to
me
quite
untenable
If
one
thing
is
more
apparent
than
another
after
reading
the
maxims
of
Sun
Tzŭ
it
is
that
their
essence
has
been
distilled
from
a
large
store
of
personal
observation
and
experience
They
reflect
the
mind
not
only
of
a
born
strategist
gifted
with
a
rare
faculty
of
generalization
but
also
of
a
practical
soldier
closely
acquainted
with
the
military
conditions
of
his
time
To
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
these
sayings
have
been
accepted
and
endorsed
by
all
the
greatest
captains
of
Chinese
history
they
offer
a
combination
of
freshness
and
sincerity
acuteness
and
common
sense
which
quite
excludes
the
idea
that
they
were
artificially
concocted
in
the
study
If
we
admit
then
that
the
chapters
were
the
genuine
production
of
a
military
man
living
towards
the
end
of
the
Ch
un
Ch
iu
period
are
we
not
bound
in
spite
of
the
silence
of
the
Tso
Chuan
to
accept
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
s
account
in
its
entirety
In
view
of
his
high
repute
as
a
sober
historian
must
we
not
hesitate
to
assume
that
the
records
he
drew
upon
for
Sun
Wu
s
biography
were
false
and
untrustworthy
The
answer
I
fear
must
be
in
the
negative
There
is
still
one
grave
if
not
fatal
objection
to
the
chronology
involved
in
the
story
as
told
in
the
Shih
Chi
which
so
far
as
I
am
aware
nobody
has
yet
pointed
out
There
are
two
passages
in
Sun
Tzŭ
in
which
he
alludes
to
contemporary
affairs
The
first
in
in
VI
Though
according
to
my
estimate
the
soldiers
of
Yüeh
exceed
our
own
in
number
that
shall
advantage
them
nothing
in
the
matter
of
victory
I
say
then
that
victory
can
be
achieved
The
other
is
in
XI
Asked
if
an
army
can
be
made
to
imitate
the
shuai
jan
I
should
answer
Yes
For
the
men
of
Wu
and
the
men
of
Yüeh
are
enemies
yet
if
they
are
crossing
a
river
in
the
same
boat
and
are
caught
by
a
storm
they
will
come
to
each
other
s
assistance
just
as
the
left
hand
helps
the
right
These
two
paragraphs
are
extremely
valuable
as
evidence
of
the
date
of
composition
They
assign
the
work
to
the
period
of
the
struggle
between
Wu
and
Yüeh
So
much
has
been
observed
by
Pi
I
hsun
But
what
has
hitherto
escaped
notice
is
that
they
also
seriously
impair
the
credibility
of
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
s
narrative
As
we
have
seen
above
the
first
positive
date
given
in
connection
with
Sun
Wu
is
B
C
He
is
then
spoken
of
as
a
general
acting
as
confidential
adviser
to
Ho
Lu
so
that
his
alleged
introduction
to
that
monarch
had
already
taken
place
and
of
course
the
chapters
must
have
been
written
earlier
still
But
at
that
time
and
for
several
years
after
down
to
the
capture
of
Ying
in
Ch
u
and
not
Yüeh
was
the
great
hereditary
enemy
of
Wu
The
two
states
Ch
u
and
Wu
had
been
constantly
at
war
for
over
half
a
century
whereas
the
first
war
between
Wu
and
Yüeh
was
waged
only
in
and
even
then
was
no
more
than
a
short
interlude
sandwiched
in
the
midst
of
the
fierce
struggle
with
Ch
u
Now
Ch
u
is
not
mentioned
in
the
chapters
at
all
The
natural
inference
is
that
they
were
written
at
a
time
when
Yüeh
had
become
the
prime
antagonist
of
Wu
that
is
after
Ch
u
had
suffered
the
great
humiliation

Final
defeat
and

of

The
sentence
quoted
above
from
VI
hardly
strikes
me
as
one
that
could
have
been
written
in
the
full
flush
of
victory
It
seems
rather
to
imply
that
for
the
moment
at
least
the
tide
had
turned
against
Wu
and
that
she
was
getting
the
worst
of
the
struggle
Hence
we
may
conclude
that
our
treatise
was
not
in
existence
in
before
which
date
Yüeh
does
not
appear
to
have
scored
any
notable
success
against
Wu
Ho
Lu
died
in
so
that
if
the
book
was
written
for
him
it
must
have
been
during
the
period
when
there
was
a
lull
in
the
hostilities
Wu
having
presumably
exhausted
by
its
supreme
effort
against
Ch
u
On
the
other
hand
if
we
choose
to
disregard
the
tradition
connecting
Sun
Wu
s
name
with
Ho
Lu
it
might
equally
well
have
seen
the
light
between
and
or
possibly
in
the
period
when
Yüeh
was
once
again
becoming
a
very
serious
menace
We
may
feel
fairly
certain
that
the
author
whoever
he
may
have
been
was
not
a
man
of
any
great
eminence
in
his
own
day
On
this
point
the
negative
testimony
of
the
Tso
Chuan
far
outweighs
any
shred
of
authority
still
attaching
to
the
Shih
Chi
if
once
its
other
facts
are
discredited
Sun
Hsing
yen
however
makes
a
feeble
attempt
to
explain
the
omission
of
his
name
from
the
great
commentary
It
was
Wu
Tzŭ
hsu
he
says
who
got
all
the
credit
of
Sun
Wu
s
exploits
because
the
latter
being
an
alien
was
not
rewarded
with
an
office
in
the
State
How
then
did
the
Sun
Tzŭ
legend
originate
It
may
be
that
the
growing
celebrity
of
the
book
imparted
by
degrees
a
kind
of
factitious
renown
to
its
author
It
was
felt
to
be
only
right
and
proper
that
one
so
well
versed
in
the
science
of
war
should
have
solid
achievements
to
his
credit
as
well
Now
the
capture
of
Ying
was
undoubtedly
the
greatest
feat
of
arms
in
Ho
Lu
s
reign
it
made
a
deep
and
lasting
impression
on
all
the
surrounding
states
and
raised
Wu
to
the
short
lived
zenith
of
her
power
Hence
what
more
natural
as
time
went
on
than
that
the
acknowledged
master
of
strategy
Sun
Wu
should
be
popularly
identified
with
that
campaign
at
first
perhaps
only
in
the
sense
that
his
brain
conceived
and
planned
it
afterwards
that
it
was
actually
carried
out
by
him
in
conjunction
with
Wu
Yuan
Po
P
ei
and
Fu
Kai
It
is
obvious
that
any
attempt
to
reconstruct
even
the
outline
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
life
must
be
based
almost
wholly
on
conjecture
With
this
necessary
proviso
I
should
say
that
he
probably
entered
the
service
of
Wu
about
the
time
of
Ho
Lu
s
accession
and
gathered
experience
though
only
in
the
capacity
of
a
subordinate
officer
during
the
intense
military
activity
which
marked
the
first
half
of
the
prince
s
reign
If
he
rose
to
be
a
general
at
all
he
certainly
was
never
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
three
above
mentioned
He
was
doubtless
present
at
the
investment
and
occupation
of
Ying
and
witnessed
Wu
s
sudden
collapse
in
the
following
year
Yüeh
s
attack
at
this
critical
juncture
when
her
rival
was
embarrassed
on
every
side
seems
to
have
convinced
him
that
this
upstart
kingdom
was
the
great
enemy
against
whom
every
effort
would
henceforth
have
to
be
directed
Sun
Wu
was
thus
a
well
seasoned
warrior
when
he
sat
down
to
write
his
famous
book
which
according
to
my
reckoning
must
have
appeared
towards
the
end
rather
than
the
beginning
of
Ho
Lu
s
reign
The
story
of
the
women
may
possibly
have
grown
out
of
some
real
incident
occurring
about
the
same
time
As
we
hear
no
more
of
Sun
Wu
after
this
from
any
source
he
is
hardly
likely
to
have
survived
his
patron
or
to
have
taken
part
in
the
death
struggle
with
Yüeh
which
began
with
the
disaster
at
Tsui
li
If
these
inferences
are
approximately
correct
there
is
a
certain
irony
in
the
fate
which
decreed
that
China
s
most
illustrious
man
of
peace
should
be
contemporary
with
her
greatest
writer
on
war
The
Text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
I
have
found
it
difficult
to
glean
much
about
the
history
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
text
The
quotations
that
occur
in
early
authors
go
to
show
that
the
chapters
of
which
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
speaks
were
essentially
the
same
as
those
now
extant
We
have
his
word
for
it
that
they
were
widely
circulated
in
his
day
and
can
only
regret
that
he
refrained
from
discussing
them
on
that
account
Sun
Hsing
yen
says
in
his
preface
During
the
Ch
in
and
Han
dynasties
Sun
Tzŭ
s
Art
of
War
was
in
general
use
amongst
military
commanders
but
they
seem
to
have
treated
it
as
a
work
of
mysterious
import
and
were
unwilling
to
expound
it
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
Thus
it
came
about
that
Wei
Wu
was
the
first
to
write
a
commentary
on
it
As
we
have
already
seen
there
is
no
reasonable
ground
to
suppose
that
Ts
ao
Kung
tampered
with
the
text
But
the
text
itself
is
often
so
obscure
and
the
number
of
editions
which
appeared
from
that
time
onward
so
great
especially
during
the
T
ang
and
Sung
dynasties
that
it
would
be
surprising
if
numerous
corruptions
had
not
managed
to
creep
in
Towards
the
middle
of
the
Sung
period
by
which
time
all
the
chief
commentaries
on
Sun
Tzŭ
were
in
existence
a
certain
Chi
T
ien
pao
published
a
work
in
chuan
entitled
Sun
Tzŭ
with
the
collected
commentaries
of
ten
writers
There
was
another
text
with
variant
readings
put
forward
by
Chu
Fu
of
Ta
hsing
which
also
had
supporters
among
the
scholars
of
that
period
but
in
the
Ming
editions
Sun
Hsing
yen
tells
us
these
readings
were
for
some
reason
or
other
no
longer
put
into
circulation
Thus
until
the
end
of
the
century
the
text
in
sole
possession
of
the
field
was
one
derived
from
Chi
T
ien
pao
s
edition
although
no
actual
copy
of
that
important
work
was
known
to
have
survived
That
therefore
is
the
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
which
appears
in
the
War
section
of
the
great
Imperial
encyclopedia
printed
in
the
Ku
Chin
T
u
Shu
Chi
Ch
eng
Another
copy
at
my
disposal
of
what
is
practically
the
same
text
with
slight
variations
is
that
contained
in
the
Eleven
philosophers
of
the
Chou
and
Ch
in
dynasties
And
the
Chinese
printed
in
Capt
Calthrop
s
first
edition
is
evidently
a
similar
version
which
has
filtered
through
Japanese
channels
So
things
remained
until
Sun
Hsing
yen
a
distinguished
antiquarian
and
classical
scholar
who
claimed
to
be
an
actual
descendant
of
Sun
Wu
accidentally
discovered
a
copy
of
Chi
T
ien
pao
s
long
lost
work
when
on
a
visit
to
the
library
of
the
Hua
yin
temple
Appended
to
it
was
the
I
Shuo
of
Cheng
Yu
Hsien
mentioned
in
the
T
ung
Chih
and
also
believed
to
have
perished
This
is
what
Sun
Hsing
yen
designates
as
the
original
edition
or
text
a
rather
misleading
name
for
it
cannot
by
any
means
claim
to
set
before
us
the
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
in
its
pristine
purity
Chi
T
ien
pao
was
a
careless
compiler
and
appears
to
have
been
content
to
reproduce
the
somewhat
debased
version
current
in
his
day
without
troubling
to
collate
it
with
the
earliest
editions
then
available
Fortunately
two
versions
of
Sun
Tzŭ
even
older
than
the
newly
discovered
work
were
still
extant
one
buried
in
the
T
ung
Tien
Tu
Yu
s
great
treatise
on
the
Constitution
the
other
similarly
enshrined
in
the
T
ai
P
ing
Yu
Lan
encyclopedia
In
both
the
complete
text
is
to
be
found
though
split
up
into
fragments
intermixed
with
other
matter
and
scattered
piecemeal
over
a
number
of
different
sections
Considering
that
the
Yu
Lan
takes
us
back
to
the
year
and
the
T
ung
Tien
about
years
further
still
to
the
middle
of
the
T
ang
dynasty
the
value
of
these
early
transcripts
of
Sun
Tzŭ
can
hardly
be
overestimated
Yet
the
idea
of
utilizing
them
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
anyone
until
Sun
Hsing
yen
acting
under
Government
instructions
undertook
a
thorough
recension
of
the
text
This
is
his
own
account
Because
of
the
numerous
mistakes
in
the
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
which
his
editors
had
handed
down
the
Government
ordered
that
the
ancient
edition
of
Chi
T
ien
pao
should
be
used
and
that
the
text
should
be
revised
and
corrected
throughout
It
happened
that
Wu
Nien
hu
the
Governor
Pi
Kua
and
Hsi
a
graduate
of
the
second
degree
had
all
devoted
themselves
to
this
study
probably
surpassing
me
therein
Accordingly
I
have
had
the
whole
work
cut
on
blocks
as
a
textbook
for
military
men
The
three
individuals
here
referred
to
had
evidently
been
occupied
on
the
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
prior
to
Sun
Hsing
yen
s
commission
but
we
are
left
in
doubt
as
to
the
work
they
really
accomplished
At
any
rate
the
new
edition
when
ultimately
produced
appeared
in
the
names
of
Sun
Hsing
yen
and
only
one
co
editor
Wu
Jen
shi
They
took
the
original
edition
as
their
basis
and
by
careful
comparison
with
older
versions
as
well
as
the
extant
commentaries
and
other
sources
of
information
such
as
the
I
Shuo
succeeded
in
restoring
a
very
large
number
of
doubtful
passages
and
turned
out
on
the
whole
what
must
be
accepted
as
the
closest
approximation
we
are
ever
likely
to
get
to
Sun
Tzŭ
s
original
work
This
is
what
will
hereafter
be
denominated
the
standard
text
The
copy
which
I
have
used
belongs
to
a
reissue
dated
It
is
in
pen
forming
part
of
a
well
printed
set
of
early
philosophical
works
in
pen
It
opens
with
a
preface
by
Sun
Hsing
yen
largely
quoted
in
this
introduction
vindicating
the
traditional
view
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
life
and
performances
and
summing
up
in
remarkably
concise
fashion
the
evidence
in
its
favour
This
is
followed
by
Ts
ao
Kung
s
preface
to
his
edition
and
the
biography
of
Sun
Tzŭ
from
the
Shih
Chi
both
translated
above
Then
come
firstly
Cheng
Yu

s
I

with
author
s
preface
and
next
a
short
miscellany
of
historical
and

information
entitled

As
regards
the
body
of
the
work
each
separate
sentence
is
followed
by
a
note
on
the
text
if
required
and
then
by
the
various
commentaries
appertaining
to
it
arranged
in
chronological
order
These
we
shall
now
proceed
to
discuss
briefly
one
by
one
The
Commentators
Sun
Tzŭ
can
boast
an
exceptionally
long
distinguished
roll
of
commentators
which
would
do
honour
to
any
classic
Ou
yang
Hsiu
remarks
on
this
fact
though
he
wrote
before
the
tale
was
complete
and
rather
ingeniously
explains
it
by
saying
that
the
artifices
of
war
being
inexhaustible
must
therefore
be
susceptible
of
treatment
in
a
great
variety
of
ways

There
is
hardly
any
room
for
doubt
that
the
earliest
commentary
on
Sun
Tzŭ
actually
came
from
the
pen
of
this
extraordinary
man
whose
biography
in
the
San
Kuo
Chih
reads
like
a
romance
One
of
the
greatest
military
geniuses
that
the
world
has
seen
and
Napoleonic
in
the
scale
of
his
operations
he
was
especially
famed
for
the
marvelous
rapidity
of
his
marches
which
has
found
expression
in
the
line
Talk
of
Ts
ao
Ts

and
Ts
ao
Ts

will
appear
Ou
yang
Hsiu
says
of
him
that
he
was
a
great
captain
who
measured
his
strength
against
Tung
Cho
Lu
Pu
and
the
two
Yuan
father
and
son
and
vanquished
them
all
whereupon
he
divided
the
Empire
of
Han
with
Wu
and
Shu
and
made
himself
king
It
is
recorded
that
whenever
a
council
of
war
was
held
by
Wei
on
the
eve
of
a
far
reaching
campaign
he
had
all
his
calculations
ready
those
generals
who
made
use
of
them
did
not
lose
one
battle
in
ten
those
who
ran
counter
to
them
in
any
particular
saw
their
armies
incontinently
beaten
and
put
to
flight
Ts
ao
Kung
s
notes
on
Sun
Tzŭ
models
of
austere
brevity
are
so
thoroughly
characteristic
of
the
stern
commander
known
to
history
that
it
is
hard
indeed
to
conceive
of
them
as
the
work
of
a
mere
littérateur
Sometimes
indeed
owing
to
extreme
compression
they
are
scarcely
intelligible
and
stand
no
less
in
need
of
a
commentary
than
the
text
itself
MENG
SHIH
The
commentary
which
has
come
down
to
us
under
this
name
is
comparatively
meager
and
nothing
about
the
author
is
known
Even
his
personal
name
has
not
been
recorded
Chi
T
ien
pao
s
edition
places
him
after
Chia
Lin
and
Ch
ao
Kung
wu
also
assigns
him
to
the
T
ang
dynasty
but
this
is
a
mistake
In
Sun
Hsing
yen
s
preface
he
appears
as
Meng
Shih
of
the
Liang
dynasty
Others
would
identify
him
with
Meng
K
ang
of
the
century
He
is
named
in
one
work
as
the
last
of
the
Five
Commentators
the
others
being
Wei
Wu
Ti
Tu
Mu
Ch
en
Hao
and
Chia
Lin
LI
CH
UAN
of
the
century
was
a
well
known
writer
on
military
tactics
One
of
his
works
has
been
in
constant
use
down
to
the
present
day
The
T
ung
Chih
mentions
Lives
of
famous
generals
from
the
Chou
to
the
T
ang
dynasty
as
written
by
him
According
to
Ch
ao
Kung
wu
and
the
T
ien
i
ko
catalogue
he
followed
a
variant
of
the
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
which
differs
considerably
from
those
now
extant
His
notes
are
mostly
short
and
to
the
point
and
he
frequently
illustrates
his
remarks
by
anecdotes
from
Chinese
history
TU
YU
died
did
not
publish
a
separate
commentary
on
Sun
Tzŭ
his
notes
being
taken
from
the
T
ung
Tien
the
encyclopedic
treatise
on
the
Constitution
which
was
his
life
work
They
are
largely
repetitions
of
Ts
ao
Kung
and
Meng
Shih
besides
which
it
is
believed
that
he
drew
on
the
ancient
commentaries
of
Wang
Ling
and
others
Owing
to
the
peculiar
arrangement
of
T
ung
Tien
he
has
to
explain
each
passage
on
its
merits
apart
from
the
context
and
sometimes
his
own
explanation
does
not
agree
with
that
of
Ts
ao
Kung
whom
he
always
quotes
first
Though
not
strictly
to
be
reckoned
as
one
of
the
Ten
Commentators
he
was
added
to
their
number
by
Chi
T
ien
pao
being
wrongly
placed
after
his
grandson
Tu
Mu
TU
MU
is
perhaps
the
best
known
as
a
poet
a
bright
star
even
in
the
glorious
galaxy
of
the
T
ang
period
We
learn
from
Ch
ao
Kung
wu
that
although
he
had
no
practical
experience
of
war
he
was
extremely
fond
of
discussing
the
subject
and
was
moreover
well
read
in
the
military
history
of
the
Ch
un
Ch
iu
and
Chan
Kuo
eras
His
notes
therefore
are
well
worth
attention
They
are
very
copious
and
replete
with
historical
parallels
The
gist
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
work
is
thus
summarized
by
him
Practice
benevolence
and
justice
but
on
the
other
hand
make
full
use
of
artifice
and
measures
of
expediency
He
further
declared
that
all
the
military
triumphs
and
disasters
of
the
thousand
years
which
had
elapsed
since
Sun
Tzŭ
s
death
would
upon
examination
be
found
to
uphold
and
corroborate
in
every
particular
the
maxims
contained
in
his
book
Tu
Mu
s
somewhat
spiteful
charge
against
Ts
ao
Kung
has
already
been
considered
elsewhere
CH
EN
HAO
appears
to
have
been
a
contemporary
of
Tu
Mu
Ch
ao
Kung
wu
says
that
he
was
impelled
to
write
a
new
commentary
on
Sun
Tzŭ
because
Ts
ao
Kung
s
on
the
one
hand
was
too
obscure
and
subtle
and
that
of
Tu
Mu
on
the
other
too
long
winded
and
diffuse
Ou
yang
Hsiu
writing
in
the
middle
of
the
century
calls
Ts
ao
Kung
Tu
Mu
and
Ch
en
Hao
the
three
chief
commentators
on
Sun
Tzŭ
and
observes
that
Ch
en
Hao
is
continually
attacking
Tu
Mu
s
shortcomings
His
commentary
though
not
lacking
in
merit
must
rank
below
those
of
his
predecessors
CHIA
LIN
is
known
to
have
lived
under
the
T
ang
dynasty
for
his
commentary
on
Sun
Tzŭ
is
mentioned
in
the
T
ang
Shu
and
was
afterwards
republished
by
Chi
Hsieh
of
the
same
dynasty
together
with
those
of
Meng
Shih
and
Tu
Yu
It
is
of
somewhat
scanty
texture
and
in
point
of
quality
too
perhaps
the
least
valuable
of
the
eleven
MEI
YAO
CH
EN
commonly
known
by
his
style
as
Mei
Sheng
yu
was
like
Tu
Mu
a
poet
of
distinction
His
commentary
was
published
with
a
laudatory
preface
by
the
great
Ou
yang
Hsiu
from
which
we
may
cull
the
following
Later
scholars
have
misread
Sun
Tzŭ
distorting
his
words
and
trying
to
make
them
square
with
their
own
one
sided
views
Thus
though
commentators
have
not
been
lacking
only
a
few
have
proved
equal
to
the
task
My
friend
Sheng
yu
has
not
fallen
into
this
mistake
In
attempting
to
provide
a
critical
commentary
for
Sun
Tzŭ
s
work
he
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
these
sayings
were
intended
for
states
engaged
in
internecine
warfare
that
the
author
is
not
concerned
with
the
military
conditions
prevailing
under
the
sovereigns
of
the
three
ancient
dynasties
nor
with
the
nine
punitive
measures
prescribed
to
the
Minister
of
War
Again
Sun
Wu
loved
brevity
of
diction
but
his
meaning
is
always
deep
Whether
the
subject
be
marching
an
army
or
handling
soldiers
or
estimating
the
enemy
or
controlling
the
forces
of
victory
it
is
always
systematically
treated
the
sayings
are
bound
together
in
strict
logical
sequence
though
this
has
been
obscured
by
commentators
who
have
probably
failed
to
grasp
their
meaning
In
his
own
commentary
Mei
Sheng
yu
has
brushed
aside
all
the
obstinate
prejudices
of
these
critics
and
has
tried
to
bring
out
the
true
meaning
of
Sun
Tzŭ
himself
In
this
way
the
clouds
of
confusion
have
been
dispersed
and
the
sayings
made
clear
I
am
convinced
that
the
present
work
deserves
to
be
handed
down
side
by
side
with
the
three
great
commentaries
and
for
a
great
deal
that
they
find
in
the
sayings
coming
generations
will
have
constant
reason
to
thank
my
friend
Sheng
yu
Making
some
allowance
for
the
exuberance
of
friendship
I
am
inclined
to
endorse
this
favourable
judgment
and
would
certainly
place
him
above
Ch
en
Hao
in
order
of
merit
WANG
HSI
also
of
the
Sung
dynasty
is
decidedly
original
in
some
of
his
interpretations
but
much
less
judicious
than
Mei
Yao
ch
en
and
on
the
whole
not
a
very
trustworthy
guide
He
is
fond
of
comparing
his
own
commentary
with
that
of
Ts
ao
Kung
but
the
comparison
is
not
often
flattering
to
him
We
learn
from
Ch
ao
Kung
wu
that
Wang
Hsi
revised
the
ancient
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
filling
up
lacunae
and
correcting
mistakes
HO
YEN
HSI
of
the
Sung
dynasty
The
personal
name
of
this
commentator
is
given
as
above
by
Cheng
Ch
iao
in
the
Tung
Chih
written
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
but
he
appears
simply
as
Ho
Shih
in
the
Yu
Hai
and
Ma
Tuan
lin
quotes
Ch
ao
Kung
wu
as
saying
that
his
personal
name
is
unknown
There
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
doubt
Cheng
Ch
iao
s
statement
otherwise
I
should
have
been
inclined
to
hazard
a
guess
and
identify
him
with
one
Ho
Ch
u
fei
the
author
of
a
short
treatise
on
war
who
lived
in
the
latter
part
of
the
century
Ho
Shih
s
commentary
in
the
words
of
the
T
ien
i
ko
catalogue
contains
helpful
additions
here
and
there
but
is
chiefly
remarkable
for
the
copious
extracts
taken
in
adapted
form
from
the
dynastic
histories
and
other
sources
CHANG
YU
The
list
closes
with
a
commentator
of
no
great
originality
perhaps
but
gifted
with
admirable
powers
of
lucid
exposition
His
commentator
is
based
on
that
of
Ts
ao
Kung
whose
terse
sentences
he
contrives
to
expand
and
develop
in
masterly
fashion
Without
Chang
Yu
it
is
safe
to
say
that
much
of
Ts
ao
Kung
s
commentary
would
have
remained
cloaked
in
its
pristine
obscurity
and
therefore
valueless
His
work
is
not
mentioned
in
the
Sung
history
the
T
ung
K
ao
or
the
Yu
Hai
but
it
finds
a
niche
in
the
T
ung
Chih
which
also
names
him
as
the
author
of
the
Lives
of
Famous
Generals
It
is
rather
remarkable
that
the
last
named
four
should
all
have
flourished
within
so
short
a
space
of
time
Ch
ao
Kung
wu
accounts
for
it
by
saying
During
the
early
years
of
the
Sung
dynasty
the
Empire
enjoyed
a
long
spell
of
peace
and
men
ceased
to
practice
the
art
of
war
but
when
Chao
Yuan
hao
s
rebellion
came
and
the
frontier
generals
were
defeated
time
after
time
the
Court
made
strenuous
inquiry
for
men
skilled
in
war
and
military
topics
became
the
vogue
amongst
all
the
high
officials
Hence
it
is
that
the
commentators
of
Sun
Tzŭ
in
our
dynasty
belong
mainly
to
that
period
Besides
these
eleven
commentators
there
are
several
others
whose
work
has
not
come
down
to
us
The
Sui
Shu
mentions
four
namely
Wang
Ling
often
quoted
by
Tu
Yu
as
Wang
Tzŭ
Chang
Tzŭ
shang
Chia
Hsu
of
Wei
and
Shen
Yu
of
Wu
The
T
ang
Shu
adds
Sun
Hao
and
the
T
ung
Chih
Hsiao
Chi
while
the
T
u
Shu
mentions
a
Ming
commentator
Huang
Jun
yu
It
is
possible
that
some
of
these
may
have
been
merely
collectors
and
editors
of
other
commentaries
like
Chi
T
ien
pao
and
Chi
Hsieh
mentioned
above
Appreciations
of
Sun
Tzŭ
Sun
Tzŭ
has
exercised
a
potent
fascination
over
the
minds
of
some
of
China
s
greatest
men
Among
the
famous
generals
who
are
known
to
have
studied
his
pages
with
enthusiasm
may
be
mentioned
Han
Hsin
d
B
C
Feng
I
d
A
D
Lu
Meng
d
and
Yo
Fei
The
opinion
of
Ts
ao
Kung
who
disputes
with
Han
Hsin
the
highest
place
in
Chinese
military
annals
has
already
been
recorded
Still
more
remarkable
in
one
way
is
the
testimony
of
purely
literary
men
such
as
Su
Hsun
the
father
of
Su
Tung
p
o
who
wrote
several
essays
on
military
topics
all
of
which
owe
their
chief
inspiration
to
Sun
Tzŭ
The
following
short
passage
by
him
is
preserved
in
the
Yu
Hai
Sun
Wu
s
saying
that
in
war
one
cannot
make
certain
of
conquering
is
very
different
indeed
from
what
other
books
tell
us
Wu
Ch
i
was
a
man
of
the
same
stamp
as
Sun
Wu
they
both
wrote
books
on
war
and
they
are
linked
together
in
popular
speech
as
Sun
and
Wu
But
Wu
Ch
i
s
remarks
on
war
are
less
weighty
his
rules
are
rougher
and
more
crudely
stated
and
there
is
not
the
same
unity
of
plan
as
in
Sun
Tzŭ
s
work
where
the
style
is
terse
but
the
meaning
fully
brought
out
The
following
is
an
extract
from
the
Impartial
Judgments
in
the
Garden
of
Literature
by
Cheng
Hou
Sun
Tzŭ
s
chapters
are
not
only
the
staple
and
base
of
all
military
men
s
training
but
also
compel
the
most
careful
attention
of
scholars
and
men
of
letters
His
sayings
are
terse
yet
elegant
simple
yet
profound
perspicuous
and
eminently
practical
Such
works
as
the
Lun
Yu
the
I
Ching
and
the
great
Commentary
as
well
as
the
writings
of
Mencius
Hsun
K
uang
and
Yang
Chu
all
fall
below
the
level
of
Sun
Tzŭ
Chu
Hsi
commenting
on
this
fully
admits
the
first
part
of
the
criticism
although
he
dislikes
the
audacious
comparison
with
the
venerated
classical
works
Language
of
this
sort
he
says
encourages
a
ruler
s
bent
towards
unrelenting
warfare
and
reckless
militarism
Apologies
for
War
Accustomed
as
we
are
to
think
of
China
as
the
greatest
peace
loving
nation
on
earth
we
are
in
some
danger
of
forgetting
that
her
experience
of
war
in
all
its
phases
has
also
been
such
as
no
modern
State
can
parallel
Her
long
military
annals
stretch
back
to
a
point
at
which
they
are
lost
in
the
mists
of
time
She
had
built
the
Great
Wall
and
was
maintaining
a
huge
standing
army
along
her
frontier
centuries
before
the
first
Roman
legionary
was
seen
on
the
Danube
What
with
the
perpetual
collisions
of
the
ancient
feudal
States
the
grim
conflicts
with
Huns
Turks
and
other
invaders
after
the
centralization
of
government
the
terrific
upheavals
which
accompanied
the
overthrow
of
so
many
dynasties
besides
the
countless
rebellions
and
minor
disturbances
that
have
flamed
up
and
flickered
out
again
one
by
one
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
clash
of
arms
has
never
ceased
to
resound
in
one
portion
or
another
of
the
Empire
No
less
remarkable
is
the
succession
of
illustrious
captains
to
whom
China
can
point
with
pride
As
in
all
countries
the
greatest
are
fond
of
emerging
at
the
most
fateful
crises
of
her
history
Thus
Po
Ch
i
stands
out
conspicuous
in
the
period
when
Ch
in
was
entering
upon
her
final
struggle
with
the
remaining
independent
states
The
stormy
years
which
followed
the
break
up
of
the
Ch
in
dynasty
are
illuminated
by
the
transcendent
genius
of
Han
Hsin
When
the
House
of
Han
in
turn
is
tottering
to
its
fall
the
great
and
baleful
figure
of
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
dominates
the
scene
And
in
the
establishment
of
the
T
ang
dynasty
one
of
the
mightiest
tasks
achieved
by
man
the
superhuman
energy
of
Li
Shih
min
afterwards
the
Emperor
T
ai
Tsung
was
seconded
by
the
brilliant
strategy
of
Li
Ching
None
of
these
generals
need
fear
comparison
with
the
greatest
names
in
the
military
history
of
Europe
In
spite
of
all
this
the
great
body
of
Chinese
sentiment
from
Lao
Tzŭ
downwards
and
especially
as
reflected
in
the
standard
literature
of
Confucianism
has
been
consistently
pacific
and
intensely
opposed
to
militarism
in
any
form
It
is
such
an
uncommon
thing
to
find
any
of
the
literati
defending
warfare
on
principle
that
I
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
collect
and
translate
a
few
passages
in
which
the
unorthodox
view
is
upheld
The
following
by
Ssu
ma
Ch
ien
shows
that
for
all
his
ardent
admiration
of
Confucius
he
was
yet
no
advocate
of
peace
at
any
price
Military
weapons
are
the
means
used
by
the
Sage
to
punish
violence
and
cruelty
to
give
peace
to
troublous
times
to
remove
difficulties
and
dangers
and
to
succour
those
who
are
in
peril
Every
animal
with
blood
in
its
veins
and
horns
on
its
head
will
fight
when
it
is
attacked
How
much
more
so
will
man
who
carries
in
his
breast
the
faculties
of
love
and
hatred
joy
and
anger
When
he
is
pleased
a
feeling
of
affection
springs
up
within
him
when
angry
his
poisoned
sting
is
brought
into
play
That
is
the
natural
law
which
governs
his
being
What
then
shall
be
said
of
those
scholars
of
our
time
blind
to
all
great
issues
and
without
any
appreciation
of
relative
values
who
can
only
bark
out
their
stale
formulas
about
virtue
and
civilization
condemning
the
use
of
military
weapons
They
will
surely
bring
our
country
to
impotence
and
dishonour
and
the
loss
of
her
rightful
heritage
or
at
the
very
least
they
will
bring
about
invasion
and
rebellion
sacrifice
of
territory
and
general
enfeeblement
Yet
they
obstinately
refuse
to
modify
the
position
they
have
taken
up
The
truth
is
that
just
as
in
the
family
the
teacher
must
not
spare
the
rod
and
punishments
cannot
be
dispensed
with
in
the
State
so
military
chastisement
can
never
be
allowed
to
fall
into
abeyance
in
the
Empire
All
one
can
say
is
that
this
power
will
be
exercised
wisely
by
some
foolishly
by
others
and
that
among
those
who
bear
arms
some
will
be
loyal
and
others
rebellious
The
next
piece
is
taken
from
Tu
Mu
s
preface
to
his
commentary
on
Sun
Tzŭ
War
may
be
defined
as
punishment
which
is
one
of
the
functions
of
government
It
was
the
profession
of
Chung
Yu
and
Jan
Ch
iu
both
disciples
of
Confucius
Nowadays
the
holding
of
trials
and
hearing
of
litigation
the
imprisonment
of
offenders
and
their
execution
by
flogging
in
the
market
place
are
all
done
by
officials
But
the
wielding
of
huge
armies
the
throwing
down
of
fortified
cities
the
hauling
of
women
and
children
into
captivity
and
the
beheading
of
traitors
this
is
also
work
which
is
done
by
officials
The
objects
of
the
rack
and
of
military
weapons
are
essentially
the
same
There
is
no
intrinsic
difference
between
the
punishment
of
flogging
and
cutting
off
heads
in
war
For
the
lesser
infractions
of
law
which
are
easily
dealt
with
only
a
small
amount
of
force
need
be
employed
hence
the
use
of
military
weapons
and
wholesale
decapitation
In
both
cases
however
the
end
in
view
is
to
get
rid
of
wicked
people
and
to
give
comfort
and
relief
to
the
good
Chi
sun
asked
Jan
Yu
saying
Have
you
Sir
acquired
your
military
aptitude
by
study
or
is
it
innate
Jan
Yu
replied
It
has
been
acquired
by
study
How
can
that
be
so
said
Chi
sun
seeing
that
you
are
a
disciple
of
Confucius
It
is
a
fact
replied
Jan
Yu
I
was
taught
by
Confucius
It
is
fitting
that
the
great
Sage
should
exercise
both
civil
and
military
functions
though
to
be
sure
my
instruction
in
the
art
of
fighting
has
not
yet
gone
very
far
Now
who
the
author
was
of
this
rigid
distinction
between
the
civil
and
the
military
and
the
limitation
of
each
to
a
separate
sphere
of
action
or
in
what
year
of
which
dynasty
it
was
first
introduced
is
more
than
I
can
say
But
at
any
rate
it
has
come
about
that
the
members
of
the
governing
class
are
quite
afraid
of
enlarging
on
military
topics
or
do
so
only
in
a
shamefaced
manner
If
any
are
bold
enough
to
discuss
the
subject
they
are
at
once
set
down
as
eccentric
individuals
of
coarse
and
brutal
propensities
This
is
an
extraordinary
instance
in
which
through
sheer
lack
of
reasoning
men
unhappily
lose
sight
of
fundamental
principles
When
the
Duke
of
Chou
was
minister
under
Ch
eng
Wang
he
regulated
ceremonies
and
made
music
and
venerated
the
arts
of
scholarship
and
learning
yet
when
the
barbarians
of
the
River
Huai
revolted
he
sallied
forth
and
chastised
them
When
Confucius
held
office
under
the
Duke
of
Lu
and
a
meeting
was
convened
at
Chia
ku
he
said
If
pacific
negotiations
are
in
progress
warlike
preparations
should
have
been
made
beforehand
He
rebuked
and
shamed
the
Marquis
of
Ch
i
who
cowered
under
him
and
dared
not
proceed
to
violence
How
can
it
be
said
that
these
two
great
Sages
had
no
knowledge
of
military
matters
We
have
seen
that
the
great
Chu
Hsi
held
Sun
Tzŭ
in
high
esteem
He
also
appeals
to
the
authority
of
the
Classics
Our
Master
Confucius
answering
Duke
Ling
of
Wei
said
I
have
never
studied
matters
connected
with
armies
and
battalions
Replying
to
K
ung
Wen
tzu
he
said
I
have
not
been
instructed
about
buff
coats
and
weapons
But
if
we
turn
to
the
meeting
at
Chia
ku
we
find
that
he
used
armed
force
against
the
men
of
Lai
so
that
the
marquis
of
Ch
i
was
overawed
Again
when
the
inhabitants
of
Pi
revolted
he
ordered
his
officers
to
attack
them
whereupon
they
were
defeated
and
fled
in
confusion
He
once
uttered
the
words
If
I
fight
I
conquer
And
Jan
Yu
also
said
The
Sage
exercises
both
civil
and
military
functions
Can
it
be
a
fact
that
Confucius
never
studied
or
received
instruction
in
the
art
of
war
We
can
only
say
that
he
did
not
specially
choose
matters
connected
with
armies
and
fighting
to
be
the
subject
of
his
teaching
Sun
Hsing
yen
the
editor
of
Sun
Tzŭ
writes
in
similar
strain
Confucius
said
I
am
unversed
in
military
matters
He
also
said
If
I
fight
I
conquer
Confucius
ordered
ceremonies
and
regulated
music
Now
war
constitutes
one
of
the
five
classes
of
State
ceremonial
and
must
not
be
treated
as
an
independent
branch
of
study
Hence
the
words
I
am
unversed
in
must
be
taken
to
mean
that
there
are
things
which
even
an
inspired
Teacher
does
not
know
Those
who
have
to
lead
an
army
and
devise
stratagems
must
learn
the
art
of
war
But
if
one
can
command
the
services
of
a
good
general
like
Sun
Tzŭ
who
was
employed
by
Wu
Tzŭ
hsu
there
is
no
need
to
learn
it
oneself
Hence
the
remark
added
by
Confucius
If
I
fight
I
conquer
The
men
of
the
present
day
however
willfully
interpret
these
words
of
Confucius
in
their
narrowest
sense
as
though
he
meant
that
books
on
the
art
of
war
were
not
worth
reading
With
blind
persistency
they
adduce
the
example
of
Chao
Kua
who
pored
over
his
father
s
books
to
no
purpose
as
a
proof
that
all
military
theory
is
useless
Again
seeing
that
books
on
war
have
to
do
with
such
things
as
opportunism
in
designing
plans
and
the
conversion
of
spies
they
hold
that
the
art
is
immoral
and
unworthy
of
a
sage
These
people
ignore
the
fact
that
the
studies
of
our
scholars
and
the
civil
administration
of
our
officials
also
require
steady
application
and
practice
before
efficiency
is
reached
The
ancients
were
particularly
chary
of
allowing
mere
novices
to
botch
their
work
Weapons
are
baneful
and
fighting
perilous
and
useless
unless
a
general
is
in
constant
practice
he
ought
not
to
hazard
other
men
s
lives
in
battle
Hence
it
is
essential
that
Sun
Tzŭ
s
chapters
should
be
studied
Hsiang
Liang
used
to
instruct
his
nephew
Chi
in
the
art
of
war
Chi
got
a
rough
idea
of
the
art
in
its
general
bearings
but
would
not
pursue
his
studies
to
their
proper
outcome
the
consequence
being
that
he
was
finally
defeated
and
overthrown
He
did
not
realize
that
the
tricks
and
artifices
of
war
are
beyond
verbal
computation
Duke
Hsiang
of
Sung
and
King
Yen
of
Hsu
were
brought
to
destruction
by
their
misplaced
humanity
The
treacherous
and
underhand
nature
of
war
necessitates
the
use
of
guile
and
stratagem
suited
to
the
occasion
There
is
a
case
on
record
of
Confucius
himself
having
violated
an
extorted
oath
and
also
of
his
having
left
the
Sung
State
in
disguise
Can
we
then
recklessly
arraign
Sun
Tzŭ
for
disregarding
truth
and
honesty

to

The

Native
critics
refer
to
a
work
of
the
Han
dynasty
which
says
Ten

outside
the
Wu
gate
of
the
city
of
Wu
now
Soochow
in

there
is
a
great

raised

commemorate
the
entertainment

Sun
Wu

excelled
in
the
art
of
war
by
the
King
of
Wu
They
attached
strings
to
wood
to
make
bows
and
sharpened
wood
to
make
arrows
The
use
of
bows
and
arrows
is
to
keep
the
Empire
in
awe

LAYING
PLANS
Ts
ao
Kung
in
defining
the
meaning
of
the
Chinese
for
the
title
of
this
chapter
says
it
refers
to
the
deliberations
in
the
temple
selected
by
the
general
for
his
temporary
use
or
as
we
should
say
in
his
tent
See
Sun
Tzŭ
said
The
art
of
war
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
State
It
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
a
road
either
to
safety
or
to
ruin
Hence
it
is
a
subject
of
inquiry
which
can
on
no
account
be
neglected
The
art
of
war
then
is
governed
by
five
constant
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
in
one
s
deliberations
when
seeking
to
determine
the
conditions
obtaining
in
the
field
These
are
The
Moral
Law
Heaven
Earth
The
Commander
Method
and
discipline
It
appears
from
what
follows
that
Sun
Tzŭ
means
by
Moral
Law
a
principle
of
harmony
not
unlike
the
Tao
of
Lao
Tzŭ
in
its
moral
aspect
One
might
be
tempted
to
render
it
by
morale
were
it
not
considered
as
an
attribute
of
the
ruler
in
The
Moral
Law
causes
the
people
to
be
in
complete
accord
with
their
ruler
so
that
they
will
follow
him
regardless
of
their
lives
undismayed
by
any
danger
Tu
Yu
quotes
Wang
Tzŭ
as
saying
Without
constant
practice
the
officers
will
be
nervous
and
undecided
when
mustering
for
battle
without
constant
practice
the
general
will
be
wavering
and
irresolute
when
the
crisis
is
at
hand
Heaven
signifies
night
and
day
cold
and
heat
times
and
seasons
The
commentators
I
think
make
an
unnecessary
mystery
of
two
words
here
Meng
Shih
refers
to
the
hard
and
the
soft
waxing
and
waning
of
Heaven
Wang
Hsi
however
may
be
right
in
saying
that
what
is
meant
is
the
general
economy
of
Heaven
including
the
five
elements
the
four
seasons
wind
and
clouds
and
other
phenomena
Earth
comprises
distances
great
and
small
danger
and
security
open
ground
and
narrow
passes
the
chances
of
life
and
death
The
Commander
stands
for
the
virtues
of
wisdom
sincerity
benevolence
courage
and
strictness
The
five
cardinal
virtues
of
the
Chinese
are
humanity
or
benevolence
uprightness
of
mind
self
respect
self
control
or
proper
feeling
wisdom
sincerity
or
good
faith
Here
wisdom
and
sincerity
are
put
before
humanity
or
benevolence
and
the
two
military
virtues
of
courage
and
strictness
substituted
for
uprightness
of
mind
and
self
respect
self
control
or
proper
feeling
By
Method
and
discipline
are
to
be
understood
the
marshalling
of
the
army
in
its
proper
subdivisions
the
gradations
of
rank
among
the
officers
the
maintenance
of
roads
by
which
supplies
may
reach
the
army
and
the
control
of
military
expenditure
These
five
heads
should
be
familiar
to
every
general
he
who
knows
them
will
be
victorious
he
who
knows
them
not
will
fail
Therefore
in
your
deliberations
when
seeking
to
determine
the
military
conditions
let
them
be
made
the
basis
of
a
comparison
in
this
wise
Which
of
the
two
sovereigns
is
imbued
with
the
Moral
law
I
e
is
in
harmony
with
his
subjects
Cf
Which
of
the
two
generals
has
most
ability
With
whom
lie
the
advantages
derived
from
Heaven
and
Earth
See
On
which
side
is
discipline
most
rigorously
enforced
Tu
Mu
alludes
to
the
remarkable
story
of
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
A
D
who
was
such
a
strict
disciplinarian
that
once
in
accordance
with
his
own
severe
regulations
against
injury
to
standing
crops
he
condemned
himself
to
death
for
having
allowed
his
horse
to
shy
into
a
field
of
corn
However
in
lieu
of
losing
his
head
he
was
persuaded
to
satisfy
his
sense
of
justice
by
cutting
off
his
hair
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
s
own
comment
on
the
present
passage
is
characteristically
curt
when
you
lay
down
a
law
see
that
it
is
not
disobeyed
if
it
is
disobeyed
the
offender
must
be
put
to
death
Which
army
is
the
stronger
Morally
as
well
as
physically
As
Mei
Yao
ch
en
puts
it
freely
rendered
esprit
de
corps
and
big
battalions
On
which
side
are
officers
and
men
more
highly
trained
Tu
Yu
quotes
Wang
Tzŭ
as
saying
Without
constant
practice
the
officers
will
be
nervous
and
undecided
when
mustering
for
battle
without
constant
practice
the
general
will
be
wavering
and
irresolute
when
the
crisis
is
at
hand
In
which
army
is
there
the
greater
constancy
both
in
reward
and
punishment
On
which
side
is
there
the
most
absolute
certainty
that
merit
will
be
properly
rewarded
and
misdeeds
summarily
punished
By
means
of
these
seven
considerations
I
can
forecast
victory
or
defeat
The
general
that
hearkens
to
my
counsel
and
acts
upon
it
will
conquer
let
such
a
one
be
retained
in
command
The
general
that
hearkens
not
to
my
counsel
nor
acts
upon
it
will
suffer
defeat
let
such
a
one
be
dismissed
The
form
of
this
paragraph
reminds
us
that
Sun
Tzŭ
s
treatise
was
composed
expressly
for
the
benefit
of
his
patron
Ho
Lu
king
of
the
Wu
State
While
heeding
the
profit
of
my
counsel
avail
yourself
also
of
any
helpful
circumstances
over
and
beyond
the
ordinary
rules
According
as
circumstances
are
favourable
one
should
modify
one
s
plans
Sun
Tzŭ
as
a
practical
soldier
will
have
none
of
the
bookish
theoric
He
cautions
us
here
not
to
pin
our
faith
to
abstract
principles
for
as
Chang
Yu
puts
it
while
the
main
laws
of
strategy
can
be
stated
clearly
enough
for
the
benefit
of
all
and
sundry
you
must
be
guided
by
the
actions
of
the
enemy
in
attempting
to
secure
a
favourable
position
in
actual
warfare
On
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
Waterloo
Lord
Uxbridge
commanding
the
cavalry
went
to
the
Duke
of
Wellington
in
order
to
learn
what
his
plans
and
calculations
were
for
the
morrow
because
as
he
explained
he
might
suddenly
find
himself
Commander
in
chief
and
would
be
unable
to
frame
new
plans
in
a
critical
moment
The
Duke
listened
quietly
and
then
said
Who
will
attack
the
first
tomorrow
I
or
Bonaparte
Bonaparte
replied
Lord
Uxbridge
Well
continued
the
Duke
Bonaparte
has
not
given
me
any
idea
of
his
projects
and
as
my
plans
will
depend
upon
his
how
can
you
expect
me
to
tell
you
what
mine
are
All
warfare
is
based
on
deception
The
truth
of
this
pithy
and
profound
saying
will
be
admitted
by
every
soldier
Col
Henderson
tells
us
that
Wellington
great
in
so
many
military
qualities
was
especially
distinguished
by
the
extraordinary
skill
with
which
he
concealed
his
movements
and
deceived
both
friend
and
foe
Hence
when
able
to
attack
we
must
seem
unable
when
using
our
forces
we
must
seem
inactive
when
we
are
near
we
must
make
the
enemy
believe
we
are
far
away
when
far
away
we
must
make
him
believe
we
are
near
Hold
out
baits
to
entice
the
enemy
Feign
disorder
and
crush
him
All
commentators
except
Chang
Yu
say
When
he
is
in
disorder
crush
him
It
is
more
natural
to
suppose
that
Sun
Tzŭ
is
still
illustrating
the
uses
of
deception
in
war
If
he
is
secure
at
all
points
be
prepared
for
him
If
he
is
in
superior
strength
evade
him
If
your
opponent
is
of
choleric
temper
seek
to
irritate
him
Pretend
to
be
weak
that
he
may
grow
arrogant
Wang
Tzŭ
quoted
by
Tu
Yu
says
that
the
good
tactician
plays
with
his
adversary
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
first
feigning
weakness
and
immobility
and
then
suddenly
pouncing
upon
him
If
he
is
taking
his
ease
give
him
no
rest
This
is
probably
the
meaning
though
Mei
Yao
ch
en
has
the
note
while
we
are
taking
our
ease
wait
for
the
enemy
to
tire
himself
out
The
Yu
Lan
has
Lure
him
on
and
tire
him
out
If
his
forces
are
united
separate
them
Less
plausible
is
the
interpretation
favoured
by
most
of
the
commentators
If
sovereign
and
subject
are
in
accord
put
division
between
them
Attack
him
where
he
is
unprepared
appear
where
you
are
not
expected
These
military
devices
leading
to
victory
must
not
be
divulged
beforehand
Now
the
general
who
wins
a
battle
makes
many
calculations
in
his
temple
ere
the
battle
is
fought
Chang
Yu
tells
us
that
in
ancient
times
it
was
customary
for
a
temple
to
be
set
apart
for
the
use
of
a
general
who
was
about
to
take
the
field
in
order
that
he
might
there
elaborate
his
plan
of
campaign
The
general
who
loses
a
battle
makes
but
few
calculations
beforehand
Thus
do
many
calculations
lead
to
victory
and
few
calculations
to
defeat
how
much
more
no
calculation
at
all
It
is
by
attention
to
this
point
that
I
can
foresee
who
is
likely
to
win
or
lose

Chapter
II
WAGING
WAR
Ts
ao
Kung
has
the
note
He
who
wishes
to
fight
must
first
count
the
cost
which
prepares
us
for
the
discovery
that
the
subject
of
the
chapter
is
not
what
we
might
expect
from
the
title
but
is
primarily
a
consideration
of
ways
and
means
Sun
Tzŭ
said
In
the
operations
of
war
where
there
are
in
the
field
a
thousand
swift
chariots
as
many
heavy
chariots
and
a
hundred
thousand
mail
clad
soldiers
The
swift
chariots
were
lightly
built
and
according
to
Chang
Yu
used
for
the
attack
the
heavy
chariots
were
heavier
and
designed
for
purposes
of
defence
Li
Ch
uan
it
is
true
says
that
the
latter
were
light
but
this
seems
hardly
probable
It
is
interesting
to
note
the
analogies
between
early
Chinese
warfare
and
that
of
the
Homeric
Greeks
In
each
case
the
war
chariot
was
the
important
factor
forming
as
it
did
the
nucleus
round
which
was
grouped
a
certain
number
of
foot
soldiers
With
regard
to
the
numbers
given
here
we
are
informed
that
each
swift
chariot
was
accompanied
by
footmen
and
each
heavy
chariot
by
footmen
so
that
the
whole
army
would
be
divided
up
into
a
thousand
battalions
each
consisting
of
two
chariots
and
a
hundred
men
with
provisions
enough
to
carry
them
a
thousand
li
modern
li
go
to
a
mile
The
length
may
have
varied
slightly
since
Sun
Tzŭ
s
time
the
expenditure
at
home
and
at
the
front
including
entertainment
of
guests
small
items
such
as
glue
and
paint
and
sums
spent
on
chariots
and
armour
will
reach
the
total
of
a
thousand
ounces
of
silver
per
day
Such
is
the
cost
of
raising
an
army
of
men
When
you
engage
in
actual
fighting
if
victory
is
long
in
coming
the
men
s
weapons
will
grow
dull
and
their
ardour
will
be
damped
If
you
lay
siege
to
a
town
you
will
exhaust
your
strength
Again
if
the
campaign
is
protracted
the
resources
of
the
State
will
not
be
equal
to
the
strain
Now
when
your
weapons
are
dulled
your
ardour
damped
your
strength
exhausted
and
your
treasure
spent
other
chieftains
will
spring
up
to
take
advantage
of
your
extremity
Then
no
man
however
wise
will
be
able
to
avert
the
consequences
that
must
ensue
Thus
though
we
have
heard
of
stupid
haste
in
war
cleverness
has
never
been
seen
associated
with
long
delays
This
concise
and
difficult
sentence
is
not
well
explained
by
any
of
the
commentators
Ts
ao
Kung
Li
Ch
uan
Meng
Shih
Tu
Yu
Tu
Mu
and
Mei
Yao
ch
en
have
notes
to
the
effect
that
a
general
though
naturally
stupid
may
nevertheless
conquer
through
sheer
force
of
rapidity
Ho
Shih
says
Haste
may
be
stupid
but
at
any
rate
it
saves
expenditure
of
energy
and
treasure
protracted
operations
may
be
very
clever
but
they
bring
calamity
in
their
train
Wang
Hsi
evades
the
difficulty
by
remarking
Lengthy
operations
mean
an
army
growing
old
wealth
being
expended
an
empty
exchequer
and
distress
among
the
people
true
cleverness
insures
against
the
occurrence
of
such
calamities
Chang
Yu
says
So
long
as
victory
can
be
attained
stupid
haste
is
preferable
to
clever
dilatoriness
Now
Sun
Tzŭ
says
nothing
whatever
except
possibly
by
implication
about
ill
considered
haste
being
better
than
ingenious
but
lengthy
operations
What
he
does
say
is
something
much
more
guarded
namely
that
while
speed
may
sometimes
be
injudicious
tardiness
can
never
be
anything
but
foolish
if
only
because
it
means
impoverishment
to
the
nation
In
considering
the
point
raised
here
by
Sun
Tzŭ
the
classic
example
of
Fabius
Cunctator
will
inevitably
occur
to
the
mind
That
general
deliberately
measured
the
endurance
of
Rome
against
that
of
Hannibals
s
isolated
army
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
latter
was
more
likely
to
suffer
from
a
long
campaign
in
a
strange
country
But
it
is
quite
a
moot
question
whether
his
tactics
would
have
proved
successful
in
the
long
run
Their
reversal
it
is
true
led
to
Cannae
but
this
only
establishes
a
negative
presumption
in
their
favour
There
is
no
instance
of
a
country
having
benefited
from
prolonged
warfare
It
is
only
one
who
is
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
evils
of
war
that
can
thoroughly
understand
the
profitable
way
of
carrying
it
on
That
is
with
rapidity
Only
one
who
knows
the
disastrous
effects
of
a
long
war
can
realize
the
supreme
importance
of
rapidity
in
bringing
it
to
a
close
Only
two
commentators
seem
to
favour
this
interpretation
but
it
fits
well
into
the
logic
of
the
context
whereas
the
rendering
He
who
does
not
know
the
evils
of
war
cannot
appreciate
its
benefits
is
distinctly
pointless
The
skilful
soldier
does
not
raise
a
second
levy
neither
are
his
supply
waggons
loaded
more
than
twice
Once
war
is
declared
he
will
not
waste
precious
time
in
waiting
for
reinforcements
nor
will
he
return
his
army
back
for
fresh
supplies
but
crosses
the
enemy
s
frontier
without
delay
This
may
seem
an
audacious
policy
to
recommend
but
with
all
great
strategists
from
Julius
Caesar
to
Napoleon
Bonaparte
the
value
of
time
that
is
being
a
little
ahead
of
your
opponent
has
counted
for
more
than
either
numerical
superiority
or
the
nicest
calculations
with
regard
to
commissariat
Bring
war
material
with
you
from
home
but
forage
on
the
enemy
Thus
the
army
will
have
food
enough
for
its
needs
The
Chinese
word
translated
here
as
war
material
literally
means
things
to
be
used
and
is
meant
in
the
widest
sense
It
includes
all
the
impedimenta
of
an
army
apart
from
provisions
Poverty
of
the
State
exchequer
causes
an
army
to
be
maintained
by
contributions
from
a
distance
Contributing
to
maintain
an
army
at
a
distance
causes
the
people
to
be
impoverished
The
beginning
of
this
sentence
does
not
balance
properly
with
the
next
though
obviously
intended
to
do
so
The
arrangement
moreover
is
so
awkward
that
I
cannot
help
suspecting
some
corruption
in
the
text
It
never
seems
to
occur
to
Chinese
commentators
that
an
emendation
may
be
necessary
for
the
sense
and
we
get
no
help
from
them
there
The
Chinese
words
Sun
Tzŭ
used
to
indicate
the
cause
of
the
people
s
impoverishment
clearly
have
reference
to
some
system
by
which
the
husbandmen
sent
their
contributions
of
corn
to
the
army
direct
But
why
should
it
fall
on
them
to
maintain
an
army
in
this
way
except
because
the
State
or
Government
is
too
poor
to
do
so
On
the
other
hand
the
proximity
of
an
army
causes
prices
to
go
up
and
high
prices
cause
the
people
s
substance
to
be
drained
away
Wang
Hsi
says
high
prices
occur
before
the
army
has
left
its
own
territory
Ts
ao
Kung
understands
it
of
an
army
that
has
already
crossed
the
frontier
When
their
substance
is
drained
away
the
peasantry
will
be
afflicted
by
heavy
exactions
With
this
loss
of
substance
and
exhaustion
of
strength
the
homes
of
the
people
will
be
stripped
bare
and
three
tenths
of
their
incomes
will
be
dissipated
Tu
Mu
and
Wang
Hsi
agree
that
the
people
are
not
mulcted
not
of
but
of
of
their
income
But
this
is
hardly
to
be
extracted
from
our
text
Ho
Shih
has
a
characteristic
tag
The
people
being
regarded
as
the
essential
part
of
the
State
and
food
as
the
people
s
heaven
is
it
not
right
that
those
in
authority
should
value
and
be
careful
of
both
while
Government
expenses
for
broken
chariots
worn
out
horses
breast
plates
and
helmets
bows
and
arrows
spears
and
shields
protective
mantlets
draught
oxen
and
heavy
waggons
will
amount
to
four
tenths
of
its
total
revenue
Hence
a
wise
general
makes
a
point
of
foraging
on
the
enemy
One
cartload
of
the
enemy
s
provisions
is
equivalent
to
twenty
of
one
s
own
and
likewise
a
single
picul
of
his
provender
is
equivalent
to
twenty
from
one
s
own
store
Because
twenty
cartloads
will
be
consumed
in
the
process
of
transporting
one
cartload
to
the
front
A
picul
is
a
unit
of
measure
equal
to
pounds
kilograms
Now
in
order
to
kill
the
enemy
our
men
must
be
roused
to
anger
that
there
may
be
advantage
from
defeating
the
enemy
they
must
have
their
rewards
Tu
Mu
says
Rewards
are
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
soldiers
see
the
advantage
of
beating
the
enemy
thus
when
you
capture
spoils
from
the
enemy
they
must
be
used
as
rewards
so
that
all
your
men
may
have
a
keen
desire
to
fight
each
on
his
own
account
Therefore
in
chariot
fighting
when
ten
or
more
chariots
have
been
taken
those
should
be
rewarded
who
took
the
first
Our
own
flags
should
be
substituted
for
those
of
the
enemy
and
the
chariots
mingled
and
used
in
conjunction
with
ours
The
captured
soldiers
should
be
kindly
treated
and
kept
This
is
called
using
the
conquered
foe
to
augment
one
s
own
strength
In
war
then
let
your
great
object
be
victory
not
lengthy
campaigns
As
Ho
Shih
remarks
War
is
not
a
thing
to
be
trifled
with
Sun
Tzŭ
here
reiterates
the
main
lesson
which
this
chapter
is
intended
to
enforce
Thus
it
may
be
known
that
the
leader
of
armies
is
the
arbiter
of
the
people
s
fate
the
man
on
whom
it
depends
whether
the
nation
shall
be
in
peace
or
in
peril
Chapter
III
ATTACK
BY
STRATAGEM
Sun
Tzŭ
said
In
the
practical
art
of
war
the
best
thing
of
all
is
to
take
the
enemy
s
country
whole
and
intact
to
shatter
and
destroy
it
is
not
so
good
So
too
it
is
better
to
capture
an
army
entire
than
to
destroy
it
to
capture
a
regiment
a
detachment
or
a
company
entire
than
to
destroy
them
The
equivalent
to
an
army
corps
according
to
Ssu
ma
Fa
consisted
nominally
of
men
according
to
Ts
ao
Kung
the
equivalent
of
a
regiment
contained
men
the
equivalent
to
a
detachment
consists
from
any
number
between
and
and
the
equivalent
of
a
company
contains
from
to
men
For
the
last
two
however
Chang
Yu
gives
the
exact
figures
of
and
respectively
Hence
to
fight
and
conquer
in
all
your
battles
is
not
supreme
excellence
supreme
excellence
consists
in
breaking
the
enemy
s
resistance
without
fighting
Here
again
no
modern
strategist
but
will
approve
the
words
of
the
old
Chinese
general
Moltke
s
greatest
triumph
the
capitulation
of
the
huge
French
army
at
Sedan
was
won
practically
without
bloodshed
Thus
the
highest
form
of
generalship
is
to
baulk
the
enemy
s
plans
Perhaps
the
word
balk
falls
short
of
expressing
the
full
force
of
the
Chinese
word
which
implies
not
an
attitude
of
defence
whereby
one
might
be
content
to
foil
the
enemy
s
stratagems
one
after
another
but
an
active
policy
of
counter
attack
Ho
Shih
puts
this
very
clearly
in
his
note
When
the
enemy
has
made
a
plan
of
attack
against
us
we
must
anticipate
him
by
delivering
our
own
attack
first
the
next
best
is
to
prevent
the
junction
of
the
enemy
s
forces
Isolating
him
from
his
allies
We
must
not
forget
that
Sun
Tzŭ
in
speaking
of
hostilities
always
has
in
mind
the
numerous
states
or
principalities
into
which
the
China
of
his
day
was
split
up
the
next
in
order
is
to
attack
the
enemy
s
army
in
the
field
When
he
is
already
at
full
strength
and
the
worst
policy
of
all
is
to
besiege
walled
cities
The
rule
is
not
to
besiege
walled
cities
if
it
can
possibly
be
avoided
Another
sound
piece
of
military
theory
Had
the
Boers
acted
upon
it
in
and
refrained
from
dissipating
their
strength
before
Kimberley
Mafeking
or
even
Ladysmith
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
would
have
been
masters
of
the
situation
before
the
British
were
ready
seriously
to
oppose
them
The
preparation
of
mantlets
movable
shelters
and
various
implements
of
war
will
take
up
three
whole
months
It
is
not
quite
clear
what
the
Chinese
word
here
translated
as
mantlets
described
Ts
ao
Kung
simply
defines
them
as
large
shields
but
we
get
a
better
idea
of
them
from
Li
Ch
uan
who
says
they
were
to
protect
the
heads
of
those
who
were
assaulting
the
city
walls
at
close
quarters
This
seems
to
suggest
a
sort
of
Roman
testudo
ready
made
Tu
Mu
says
they
were
wheeled
vehicles
used
in
repelling
attacks
but
this
is
denied
by
Ch
en
Hao
See
supra
II
The
name
is
also
applied
to
turrets
on
city
walls
Of
the
movable
shelters
we
get
a
fairly
clear
description
from
several
commentators
They
were
wooden
missile
proof
structures
on
four
wheels
propelled
from
within
covered
over
with
raw
hides
and
used
in
sieges
to
convey
parties
of
men
to
and
from
the
walls
for
the
purpose
of
filling
up
the
encircling
moat
with
earth
Tu
Mu
adds
that
they
are
now
called
wooden
donkeys
and
the
piling
up
of
mounds
over
against
the
walls
will
take
three
months
more
These
were
great
mounds
or
ramparts
of
earth
heaped
up
to
the
level
of
the
enemy
s
walls
in
order
to
discover
the
weak
points
in
the
defence
and
also
to
destroy
the
fortified
turrets
mentioned
in
the
preceding
note
The
general
unable
to
control
his
irritation
will
launch
his
men
to
the
assault
like
swarming
ants
This
vivid
simile
of
Ts
ao
Kung
is
taken
from
the
spectacle
of
an
army
of
ants
climbing
a
wall
The
meaning
is
that
the
general
losing
patience
at
the
long
delay
may
make
a
premature
attempt
to
storm
the
place
before
his
engines
of
war
are
ready
with
the
result
that
one
third
of
his
men
are
slain
while
the
town
still
remains
untaken
Such
are
the
disastrous
effects
of
a
siege
We
are
reminded
of
the
terrible
losses
of
the
Japanese
before
Port
Arthur
in
the
most
recent
siege
which
history
has
to
record
Therefore
the
skilful
leader
subdues
the
enemy
s
troops
without
any
fighting
he
captures
their
cities
without
laying
siege
to
them
he
overthrows
their
kingdom
without
lengthy
operations
in
the
field
Chia
Lin
notes
that
he
only
overthrows
the
Government
but
does
no
harm
to
individuals
The
classical
instance
is
Wu
Wang
who
after
having
put
an
end
to
the
Yin
dynasty
was
acclaimed
Father
and
mother
of
the
people
With
his
forces
intact
he
will
dispute
the
mastery
of
the
Empire
and
thus
without
losing
a
man
his
triumph
will
be
complete
Owing
to
the
double
meanings
in
the
Chinese
text
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence
is
susceptible
of
quite
a
different
meaning
And
thus
the
weapon
not
being
blunted
by
use
its
keenness
remains
perfect
This
is
the
method
of
attacking
by
stratagem
It
is
the
rule
in
war
if
our
forces
are
ten
to
the
enemy
s
one
to
surround
him
if
five
to
one
to
attack
him
Straightway
without
waiting
for
any
further
advantage
if
twice
as
numerous
to
divide
our
army
into
two
Tu
Mu
takes
exception
to
the
saying
and
at
first
sight
indeed
it
appears
to
violate
a
fundamental
principle
of
war
Ts
ao
Kung
however
gives
a
clue
to
Sun
Tzŭ
s
meaning
Being
two
to
the
enemy
s
one
we
may
use
one
part
of
our
army
in
the
regular
way
and
the
other
for
some
special
diversion
Chang
Yu
thus
further
elucidates
the
point
If
our
force
is
twice
as
numerous
as
that
of
the
enemy
it
should
be
split
up
into
two
divisions
one
to
meet
the
enemy
in
front
and
one
to
fall
upon
his
rear
if
he
replies
to
the
frontal
attack
he
may
be
crushed
from
behind
if
to
the
rearward
attack
he
may
be
crushed
in
front
This
is
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
one
part
may
be
used
in
the
regular
way
and
the
other
for
some
special
diversion
Tu
Mu
does
not
understand
that
dividing
one
s
army
is
simply
an
irregular
just
as
concentrating
it
is
the
regular
strategical
method
and
he
is
too
hasty
in
calling
this
a
mistake
If
equally
matched
we
can
offer
battle
Li
Ch
uan
followed
by
Ho
Shih
gives
the
following
paraphrase
If
attackers
and
attacked
are
equally
matched
in
strength
only
the
able
general
will
fight
if
slightly
inferior
in
numbers
we
can
avoid
the
enemy
The
meaning
we
can
watch
the
enemy
is
certainly
a
great
improvement
on
the
above
but
unfortunately
there
appears
to
be
no
very
good
authority
for
the
variant
Chang
Yu
reminds
us
that
the
saying
only
applies
if
the
other
factors
are
equal
a
small
difference
in
numbers
is
often
more
than
counterbalanced
by
superior
energy
and
discipline
if
quite
unequal
in
every
way
we
can
flee
from
him
Hence
though
an
obstinate
fight
may
be
made
by
a
small
force
in
the
end
it
must
be
captured
by
the
larger
force
Now
the
general
is
the
bulwark
of
the
State
if
the
bulwark
is
complete
at
all
points
the
State
will
be
strong
if
the
bulwark
is
defective
the
State
will
be
weak
As
Li
Ch
uan
tersely
puts
it
Gap
indicates
deficiency
if
the
general
s
ability
is
not
perfect
i
e
if
he
is
not
thoroughly
versed
in
his
profession
his
army
will
lack
strength
There
are
three
ways
in
which
a
ruler
can
bring
misfortune
upon
his
army
By
commanding
the
army
to
advance
or
to
retreat
being
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
it
cannot
obey
This
is
called
hobbling
the
army
Li
Ch
uan
adds
the
comment
It
is
like
tying
together
the
legs
of
a
thoroughbred
so
that
it
is
unable
to
gallop
One
would
naturally
think
of
the
ruler
in
this
passage
as
being
at
home
and
trying
to
direct
the
movements
of
his
army
from
a
distance
But
the
commentators
understand
just
the
reverse
and
quote
the
saying
of
T
ai
Kung
A
kingdom
should
not
be
governed
from
without
and
army
should
not
be
directed
from
within
Of
course
it
is
true
that
during
an
engagement
or
when
in
close
touch
with
the
enemy
the
general
should
not
be
in
the
thick
of
his
own
troops
but
a
little
distance
apart
Otherwise
he
will
be
liable
to
misjudge
the
position
as
a
whole
and
give
wrong
orders
By
attempting
to
govern
an
army
in
the
same
way
as
he
administers
a
kingdom
being
ignorant
of
the
conditions
which
obtain
in
an
army
This
causes
restlessness
in
the
soldier
s
minds
Ts
ao
Kung
s
note
is
freely
translated
The
military
sphere
and
the
civil
sphere
are
wholly
distinct
you
can
t
handle
an
army
in
kid
gloves
And
Chang
Yu
says
Humanity
and
justice
are
the
principles
on
which
to
govern
a
state
but
not
an
army
opportunism
and
flexibility
on
the
other
hand
are
military
rather
than
civil
virtues
to
assimilate
the
governing
of
an
army
to
that
of
a
State
understood
By
employing
the
officers
of
his
army
without
discrimination
That
is
he
is
not
careful
to
use
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
through
ignorance
of
the
military
principle
of
adaptation
to
circumstances
This
shakes
the
confidence
of
the
soldiers
I
follow
Mei
Yao
ch
en
here
The
other
commentators
refer
not
to
the
ruler
as
in
but
to
the
officers
he
employs
Thus
Tu
Yu
says
If
a
general
is
ignorant
of
the
principle
of
adaptability
he
must
not
be
entrusted
with
a
position
of
authority
Tu
Mu
quotes
The
skilful
employer
of
men
will
employ
the
wise
man
the
brave
man
the
covetous
man
and
the
stupid
man
For
the
wise
man
delights
in
establishing
his
merit
the
brave
man
likes
to
show
his
courage
in
action
the
covetous
man
is
quick
at
seizing
advantages
and
the
stupid
man
has
no
fear
of
death
But
when
the
army
is
restless
and
distrustful
trouble
is
sure
to
come
from
the
other
feudal
princes
This
is
simply
bringing
anarchy
into
the
army
and
flinging
victory
away
Thus
we
may
know
that
there
are
five
essentials
for
victory
He
will
win
who
knows
when
to
fight
and
when
not
to
fight
Chang
Yu
says
If
he
can
fight
he
advances
and
takes
the
offensive
if
he
cannot
fight
he
retreats
and
remains
on
the
defensive
He
will
invariably
conquer
who
knows
whether
it
is
right
to
take
the
offensive
or
the
defensive
He
will
win
who
knows
how
to
handle
both
superior
and
inferior
forces
This
is
not
merely
the
general
s
ability
to
estimate
numbers
correctly
as
Li
Ch
uan
and
others
make
out
Chang
Yu
expounds
the
saying
more
satisfactorily
By
applying
the
art
of
war
it
is
possible
with
a
lesser
force
to
defeat
a
greater
and
vice
versa
The
secret
lies
in
an
eye
for
locality
and
in
not
letting
the
right
moment
slip
Thus
Wu
Tzŭ
says
With
a
superior
force
make
for
easy
ground
with
an
inferior
one
make
for
difficult
ground
He
will
win
whose
army
is
animated
by
the
same
spirit
throughout
all
its
ranks
He
will
win
who
prepared
himself
waits
to
take
the
enemy
unprepared
He
will
win
who
has
military
capacity
and
is
not
interfered
with
by
the
sovereign
Tu
Yu
quotes
Wang
Tzŭ
as
saying
It
is
the
sovereign
s
function
to
give
broad
instructions
but
to
decide
on
battle
it
is
the
function
of
the
general
It
is
needless
to
dilate
on
the
military
disasters
which
have
been
caused
by
undue
interference
with
operations
in
the
field
on
the
part
of
the
home
government
Napoleon
undoubtedly
owed
much
of
his
extraordinary
success
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
hampered
by
central
authority
Victory
lies
in
the
knowledge
of
these
five
points
Literally
These
five
things
are
knowledge
of
the
principle
of
victory
Hence
the
saying
If
you
know
the
enemy
and
know
yourself
you
need
not
fear
the
result
of
a
hundred
battles
If
you
know
yourself
but
not
the
enemy
for
every
victory
gained
you
will
also
suffer
a
defeat
Li
Ch
uan
cites
the
case
of
Fu
Chien
prince
of
Ch
in
who
in
A
D
marched
with
a
vast
army
against
the
Chin
Emperor
When
warned
not
to
despise
an
enemy
who
could
command
the
services
of
such
men
as
Hsieh
An
and
Huan
Ch
ung
he
boastfully
replied
I
have
the
population
of
eight
provinces
at
my
back
infantry
and
horsemen
to
the
number
of
one
million
why
they
could
dam
up
the
Yangtsze
River
itself
by
merely
throwing
their
whips
into
the
stream
What
danger
have
I
to
fear
Nevertheless
his
forces
were
soon
after
disastrously
routed
at
the
Fei
River
and
he
was
obliged
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
If
you
know
neither
the
enemy
nor
yourself
you
will
succumb
in
every
battle
Chang
Yu
said
Knowing
the
enemy
enables
you
to
take
the
offensive
knowing
yourself
enables
you
to
stand
on
the
defensive
He
adds
Attack
is
the
secret
of
defence
defence
is
the
planning
of
an
attack
It
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
epitome
of
the
root
principle
of
war
Chapter
IV
TACTICAL
DISPOSITIONS
Ts
ao
Kung
explains
the
Chinese
meaning
of
the
words
for
the
title
of
this
chapter
marching
and
countermarching
on
the
part
of
the
two
armies
with
a
view
to
discovering
each
other
s
condition
Tu
Mu
says
It
is
through
the
dispositions
of
an
army
that
its
condition
may
be
discovered
Conceal
your
dispositions
and
your
condition
will
remain
secret
which
leads
to
victory
show
your
dispositions
and
your
condition
will
become
patent
which
leads
to
defeat
Wang
Hsi
remarks
that
the
good
general
can
secure
success
by
modifying
his
tactics
to
meet
those
of
the
enemy
Sun
Tzŭ
said
The
good
fighters
of
old
first
put
themselves
beyond
the
possibility
of
defeat
and
then
waited
for
an
opportunity
of
defeating
the
enemy
To
secure
ourselves
against
defeat
lies
in
our
own
hands
but
the
opportunity
of
defeating
the
enemy
is
provided
by
the
enemy
himself
That
is
of
course
by
a
mistake
on
the
enemy
s
part
Thus
the
good
fighter
is
able
to
secure
himself
against
defeat
Chang
Yu
says
this
is
done
By
concealing
the
disposition
of
his
troops
covering
up
his
tracks
and
taking
unremitting
precautions
but
cannot
make
certain
of
defeating
the
enemy
Hence
the
saying
One
may
know
how
to
conquer
without
being
able
to
do
it
Security
against
defeat
implies
defensive
tactics
ability
to
defeat
the
enemy
means
taking
the
offensive
I
retain
the
sense
found
in
a
similar
passage
in
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
commentators
are
all
against
me
The
meaning
they
give
He
who
cannot
conquer
takes
the
defensive
is
plausible
enough
Standing
on
the
defensive
indicates
insufficient
strength
attacking
a
superabundance
of
strength
The
general
who
is
skilled
in
defence
hides
in
the
most
secret
recesses
of
the
earth
Literally
hides
under
the
ninth
earth
which
is
a
metaphor
indicating
the
utmost
secrecy
and
concealment
so
that
the
enemy
may
not
know
his
whereabouts
he
who
is
skilled
in
attack
flashes
forth
from
the
topmost
heights
of
heaven
Another
metaphor
implying
that
he
falls
on
his
adversary
like
a
thunderbolt
against
which
there
is
no
time
to
prepare
This
is
the
opinion
of
most
of
the
commentators
Thus
on
the
one
hand
we
have
ability
to
protect
ourselves
on
the
other
a
victory
that
is
complete
To
see
victory
only
when
it
is
within
the
ken
of
the
common
herd
is
not
the
acme
of
excellence
As
Ts
ao
Kung
remarks
the
thing
is
to
see
the
plant
before
it
has
germinated
to
foresee
the
event
before
the
action
has
begun
Li
Ch
uan
alludes
to
the
story
of
Han
Hsin
who
when
about
to
attack
the
vastly
superior
army
of
Chao
which
was
strongly
entrenched
in
the
city
of
Ch
eng
an
said
to
his
officers
Gentlemen
we
are
going
to
annihilate
the
enemy
and
shall
meet
again
at
dinner
The
officers
hardly
took
his
words
seriously
and
gave
a
very
dubious
assent
But
Han
Hsin
had
already
worked
out
in
his
mind
the
details
of
a
clever
stratagem
whereby
as
he
foresaw
he
was
able
to
capture
the
city
and
inflict
a
crushing
defeat
on
his
adversary
Neither
is
it
the
acme
of
excellence
if
you
fight
and
conquer
and
the
whole
Empire
says
Well
done
True
excellence
being
as
Tu
Mu
says
To
plan
secretly
to
move
surreptitiously
to
foil
the
enemy
s
intentions
and
balk
his
schemes
so
that
at
last
the
day
may
be
won
without
shedding
a
drop
of
blood
Sun
Tzŭ
reserves
his
approbation
for
things
that
the
world
s
coarse
thumb
And
finger
fail
to
plumb
To
lift
an
autumn
hair
is
no
sign
of
great
strength
Autumn
hair
is
explained
as
the
fur
of
a
hare
which
is
finest
in
autumn
when
it
begins
to
grow
afresh
The
phrase
is
a
very
common
one
in
Chinese
writers
to
see
sun
and
moon
is
no
sign
of
sharp
sight
to
hear
the
noise
of
thunder
is
no
sign
of
a
quick
ear
Ho
Shih
gives
as
real
instances
of
strength
sharp
sight
and
quick
hearing
Wu
Huo
who
could
lift
a
tripod
weighing
stone
Li
Chu
who
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
could
see
objects
no
bigger
than
a
mustard
seed
and
Shih
K
uang
a
blind
musician
who
could
hear
the
footsteps
of
a
mosquito
What
the
ancients
called
a
clever
fighter
is
one
who
not
only
wins
but
excels
in
winning
with
ease
The
last
half
is
literally
one
who
conquering
excels
in
easy
conquering
Mei
Yao
ch
en
says
He
who
only
sees
the
obvious
wins
his
battles
with
difficulty
he
who
looks
below
the
surface
of
things
wins
with
ease
Hence
his
victories
bring
him
neither
reputation
for
wisdom
nor
credit
for
courage
Tu
Mu
explains
this
very
well
Inasmuch
as
his
victories
are
gained
over
circumstances
that
have
not
come
to
light
the
world
as
large
knows
nothing
of
them
and
he
wins
no
reputation
for
wisdom
inasmuch
as
the
hostile
state
submits
before
there
has
been
any
bloodshed
he
receives
no
credit
for
courage
He
wins
his
battles
by
making
no
mistakes
Ch
en
Hao
says
He
plans
no
superfluous
marches
he
devises
no
futile
attacks
The
connection
of
ideas
is
thus
explained
by
Chang
Yu
One
who
seeks
to
conquer
by
sheer
strength
clever
though
he
may
be
at
winning
pitched
battles
is
also
liable
on
occasion
to
be
vanquished
whereas
he
who
can
look
into
the
future
and
discern
conditions
that
are
not
yet
manifest
will
never
make
a
blunder
and
therefore
invariably
win
Making
no
mistakes
is
what
establishes
the
certainty
of
victory
for
it
means
conquering
an
enemy
that
is
already
defeated
Hence
the
skilful
fighter
puts
himself
into
a
position
which
makes
defeat
impossible
and
does
not
miss
the
moment
for
defeating
the
enemy
A
counsel
of
perfection
as
Tu
Mu
truly
observes
Position
need
not
be
confined
to
the
actual
ground
occupied
by
the
troops
It
includes
all
the
arrangements
and
preparations
which
a
wise
general
will
make
to
increase
the
safety
of
his
army
Thus
it
is
that
in
war
the
victorious
strategist
only
seeks
battle
after
the
victory
has
been
won
whereas
he
who
is
destined
to
defeat
first
fights
and
afterwards
looks
for
victory
Ho
Shih
thus
expounds
the
paradox
In
warfare
first
lay
plans
which
will
ensure
victory
and
then
lead
your
army
to
battle
if
you
will
not
begin
with
stratagem
but
rely
on
brute
strength
alone
victory
will
no
longer
be
assured
The
consummate
leader
cultivates
the
moral
law
and
strictly
adheres
to
method
and
discipline
thus
it
is
in
his
power
to
control
success
In
respect
of
military
method
we
have
firstly
Measurement
secondly
Estimation
of
quantity
thirdly
Calculation
fourthly
Balancing
of
chances
fifthly
Victory
Measurement
owes
its
existence
to
Earth
Estimation
of
quantity
to
Measurement
Calculation
to
Estimation
of
quantity
Balancing
of
chances
to
Calculation
and
Victory
to
Balancing
of
chances
It
is
not
easy
to
distinguish
the
four
terms
very
clearly
in
the
Chinese
The
first
seems
to
be
surveying
and
measurement
of
the
ground
which
enable
us
to
form
an
estimate
of
the
enemy
s
strength
and
to
make
calculations
based
on
the
data
thus
obtained
we
are
thus
led
to
a
general
weighing
up
or
comparison
of
the
enemy
s
chances
with
our
own
if
the
latter
turn
the
scale
then
victory
ensues
The
chief
difficulty
lies
in
third
term
which
in
the
Chinese
some
commentators
take
as
a
calculation
of
numbers
thereby
making
it
nearly
synonymous
with
the
second
term
Perhaps
the
second
term
should
be
thought
of
as
a
consideration
of
the
enemy
s
general
position
or
condition
while
the
third
term
is
the
estimate
of
his
numerical
strength
On
the
other
hand
Tu
Mu
says
The
question
of
relative
strength
having
been
settled
we
can
bring
the
varied
resources
of
cunning
into
play
Ho
Shih
seconds
this
interpretation
but
weakens
it
However
it
points
to
the
third
term
as
being
a
calculation
of
numbers
A
victorious
army
opposed
to
a
routed
one
is
as
a
pound
s
weight
placed
in
the
scale
against
a
single
grain
Literally
a
victorious
army
is
like
an
i
oz
weighed
against
a
shu
oz
a
routed
army
is
a
shu
weighed
against
an
i
The
point
is
simply
the
enormous
advantage
which
a
disciplined
force
flushed
with
victory
has
over
one
demoralized
by
defeat
Legge
in
his
note
on
Mencius
I
ix
makes
the
i
to
be
Chinese
ounces
and
corrects
Chu
Hsi
s
statement
that
it
equaled
oz
only
But
Li
Ch
uan
of
the
T
ang
dynasty
here
gives
the
same
figure
as
Chu
Hsi
The
onrush
of
a
conquering
force
is
like
the
bursting
of
pent
up
waters
into
a
chasm
a
thousand
fathoms
deep
So
much
for
tactical
dispositions
Chapter
V
ENERGY
Sun
Tzŭ
said
The
control
of
a
large
force
is
the
same
principle
as
the
control
of
a
few
men
it
is
merely
a
question
of
dividing
up
their
numbers
That
is
cutting
up
the
army
into
regiments
companies
etc
with
subordinate
officers
in
command
of
each
Tu
Mu
reminds
us
of
Han
Hsin
s
famous
reply
to
the
first
Han
Emperor
who
once
said
to
him
How
large
an
army
do
you
think
I
could
lead
Not
more
than
men
your
Majesty
And
you
asked
the
Emperor
Oh
he
answered
the
more
the
better
Fighting
with
a
large
army
under
your
command
is
nowise
different
from
fighting
with
a
small
one
it
is
merely
a
question
of
instituting
signs
and
signals
To
ensure
that
your
whole
host
may
withstand
the
brunt
of
the
enemy
s
attack
and
remain
unshaken
this
is
effected
by
manœuvers
direct
and
indirect
We
now
come
to
one
of
the
most
interesting
parts
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
treatise
the
discussion
of
the
cheng
and
the
ch
i
As
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
grasp
the
full
significance
of
these
two
terms
or
to
render
them
consistently
by
good
English
equivalents
it
may
be
as
well
to
tabulate
some
of
the
commentators
remarks
on
the
subject
before
proceeding
further

We
must
cause
the
enemy
to
regard
our
straightforward
attack
as
one
that
is
secretly
designed
and
vice
versa
thus

may
also
be

and

may

be

the
famous
exploit
of
Han

when

ostensibly
against
Lin

Chao

Chang
Yu
gives
the
following
summary
of
opinions
on
the
words
Military
writers
do
not
agree
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
ch
i
and
cheng
Wei
Liao
Tzŭ
cent
B
C
says
Direct
warfare
favours
frontal
attacks
indirect
warfare
attacks
from
the
rear
Ts
ao
Kung
says
Going
straight
out
to
join
battle
is
a
direct
operation
appearing
on
the
enemy
s
rear
is
an
indirect
manœuver
Li
Wei
kung
and

A
D
says
In
war
to
march

ahead

cheng
turning
movements
on
the
other
hand
are
ch
i
These
writers
simply
regard
cheng
as
cheng
and
ch
i
as
ch
i
they
do
not
note
that
the
two
are
mutually
interchangeable
and
run
into
each
other
like
the
two
sides
of
a
circle
see
infra
A
comment
on
the
T
ang
Emperor
T
ai
Tsung
goes
to
the
root
of
the
matter
A
ch
i
manœuver
may
be
cheng
if
we
make
the
enemy
look
upon
it
as
cheng
then
our
real
attack
will
be
ch
i
and
vice
versa
The
whole
secret
lies
in
confusing
the
enemy
so
that
he
cannot
fathom
our
real
intent
To
put
it
perhaps
a
little
more
clearly
any
attack
or
other
operation
is
cheng
on
which
the
enemy
has
had
his
attention
fixed
whereas
that
is
ch
i
which
takes
him
by
surprise
or
comes
from
an
unexpected
quarter
If
the
enemy
perceives
a
movement
which
is
meant
to
be
ch
i
it
immediately
becomes
cheng
That
the
impact
of
your
army
may
be
like
a
grindstone
dashed
against
an
egg
this
is
effected
by
the
science
of
weak
points
and
strong
In
all
fighting
the
direct
method
may
be
used
for
joining
battle
but
indirect
methods
will
be
needed
in
order
to
secure
victory
Chang
Yu
says
Steadily
develop
indirect
tactics
either
by
pounding
the
enemy
s
flanks
or
falling
on
his
rear
A
brilliant
example
of
indirect
tactics
which
decided
the
fortunes
of
a
campaign
was
Lord
Roberts
night
march
round
the
Peiwar
Kotal
in
the
second
Afghan
war
Indirect
tactics
efficiently
applied
are
inexhausible
as
Heaven
and
Earth
unending
as
the
flow
of
rivers
and
streams
like
the
sun
and
moon
they
end
but
to
begin
anew
like
the
four
seasons
they
pass
away
but
to
return
once
more
Tu
Yu
and
Chang
Yu
understand
this
of
the
permutations
of
ch
i
and
cheng
But
at
present
Sun
Tzŭ
is
not
speaking
of
cheng
at
all
unless
indeed
we
suppose
with
Cheng
Yu
hsien
that
a
clause
relating
to
it
has
fallen
out
of
the
text
Of
course
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
the
two
are
so
inextricably
interwoven
in
all
military
operations
that
they
cannot
really
be
considered
apart
Here
we
simply
have
an
expression
in
figurative
language
of
the
almost
infinite
resource
of
a
great
leader
There
are
not
more
than
five
musical
notes
yet
the
combinations
of
these
five
give
rise
to
more
melodies
than
can
ever
be
heard
There
are
not
more
than
five
primary
colours
blue
yellow
red
white
and
black
yet
in
combination
they
produce
more
hues
than
can
ever
be
seen
There
are
not
more
than
five
cardinal
tastes
sour
acrid
salt
sweet
bitter
yet
combinations
of
them
yield
more
flavours
than
can
ever
be
tasted
In
battle
there
are
not
more
than
two
methods
of
attack
the
direct
and
the
indirect
yet
these
two
in
combination
give
rise
to
an
endless
series
of
manœuvers
The
direct
and
the
indirect
lead
on
to
each
other
in
turn
It
is
like
moving
in
a
circle
you
never
come
to
an
end
Who
can
exhaust
the
possibilities
of
their
combination
The
onset
of
troops
is
like
the
rush
of
a
torrent
which
will
even
roll
stones
along
in
its
course
The
quality
of
decision
is
like
the
well
timed
swoop
of
a
falcon
which
enables
it
to
strike
and
destroy
its
victim
The
Chinese
here
is
tricky
and
a
certain
key
word
in
the
context
it
is
used
defies
the
best
efforts
of
the
translator
Tu
Mu
defines
this
word
as
the
measurement
or
estimation
of
distance
But
this
meaning
does
not
quite
fit
the
illustrative
simile
in
Applying
this
definition
to
the
falcon
it
seems
to
me
to
denote
that
instinct
of
self
restraint
which
keeps
the
bird
from
swooping
on
its
quarry
until
the
right
moment
together
with
the
power
of
judging
when
the
right
moment
has
arrived
The
analogous
quality
in
soldiers
is
the
highly
important
one
of
being
able
to
reserve
their
fire
until
the
very
instant
at
which
it
will
be
most
effective
When
the
Victory
went
into
action
at
Trafalgar
at
hardly
more
than
drifting
pace
she
was
for
several
minutes
exposed
to
a
storm
of
shot
and
shell
before
replying
with
a
single
gun
Nelson
coolly
waited
until
he
was
within
close
range
when
the
broadside
he
brought
to
bear
worked
fearful
havoc
on
the
enemy
s
nearest
ships
Therefore
the
good
fighter
will
be
terrible
in
his
onset
and
prompt
in
his
decision
The
word
decision
would
have
reference
to
the
measurement
of
distance
mentioned
above
letting
the
enemy
get
near
before
striking
But
I
cannot
help
thinking
that
Sun
Tzŭ
meant
to
use
the
word
in
a
figurative
sense
comparable
to
our
own
idiom
short
and
sharp
Cf
Wang
Hsi
s
note
which
after
describing
the
falcon
s
mode
of
attack
proceeds
This
is
just
how
the
psychological
moment
should
be
seized
in
war
Energy
may
be
likened
to
the
bending
of
a
crossbow
decision
to
the
releasing
of
the
trigger
None
of
the
commentators
seem
to
grasp
the
real
point
of
the
simile
of
energy
and
the
force
stored
up
in
the
bent
cross
bow
until
released
by
the
finger
on
the
trigger
Amid
the
turmoil
and
tumult
of
battle
there
may
be
seeming
disorder
and
yet
no
real
disorder
at
all
amid
confusion
and
chaos
your
array
may
be
without
head
or
tail
yet
it
will
be
proof
against
defeat
Mei
Yao
ch
en
says
The
subdivisions
of
the
army
having
been
previously
fixed
and
the
various
signals
agreed
upon
the
separating
and
joining
the
dispersing
and
collecting
which
will
take
place
in
the
course
of
a
battle
may
give
the
appearance
of
disorder
when
no
real
disorder
is
possible
Your
formation
may
be
without
head
or
tail
your
dispositions
all
topsy
turvy
and
yet
a
rout
of
your
forces
quite
out
of
the
question
Simulated
disorder
postulates
perfect
discipline
simulated
fear
postulates
courage
simulated
weakness
postulates
strength
In
order
to
make
the
translation
intelligible
it
is
necessary
to
tone
down
the
sharply
paradoxical
form
of
the
original
Ts
ao
Kung
throws
out
a
hint
of
the
meaning
in
his
brief
note
These
things
all
serve
to
destroy
formation
and
conceal
one
s
condition
But
Tu
Mu
is
the
first
to
put
it
quite
plainly
If
you
wish
to
feign
confusion
in
order
to
lure
the
enemy
on
you
must
first
have
perfect
discipline
if
you
wish
to
display
timidity
in
order
to
entrap
the
enemy
you
must
have
extreme
courage
if
you
wish
to
parade
your
weakness
in
order
to
make
the
enemy
over
confident
you
must
have
exceeding
strength
Hiding
order
beneath
the
cloak
of
disorder
is
simply
a
question
of
subdivision
See
supra
concealing
courage
under
a
show
of
timidity
presupposes
a
fund
of
latent
energy
The
commentators
strongly
understand
a
certain
Chinese
word
here
differently
than
anywhere
else
in
this
chapter
Thus
Tu
Mu
says
seeing
that
we
are
favourably
circumstanced
and
yet
make
no
move
the
enemy
will
believe
that
we
are
really
afraid
masking
strength
with
weakness
is
to
be
effected
by
tactical
dispositions
Chang
Yu
relates
the
following
anecdote
of
Kao
Tsu
the
first
Han
Emperor
Wishing
to
crush
the
Hsiung
nu
he
sent
out
spies
to
report
on
their
condition
But
the
Hsiung
nu
forewarned
carefully
concealed
all
their
able
bodied
men
and
well
fed
horses
and
only
allowed
infirm
soldiers
and
emaciated
cattle
to
be
seen
The
result
was
that
spies
one
and
all
recommended
the
Emperor
to
deliver
his
attack
Lou
Ching
alone
opposed
them
saying
When
two
countries
go
to
war
they
are
naturally
inclined
to
make
an
ostentatious
display
of
their
strength
Yet
our
spies
have
seen
nothing
but
old
age
and
infirmity
This
is
surely
some
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
and
it
would
be
unwise
for
us
to
attack
The
Emperor
however
disregarding
this
advice
fell
into
the
trap
and
found
himself
surrounded
at
Po
teng
Thus
one
who
is
skilful
at
keeping
the
enemy
on
the
move
maintains
deceitful
appearances
according
to
which
the
enemy
will
act
Ts
ao
Kung
s
note
is
Make
a
display
of
weakness
and
want
Tu
Mu
says
If
our
force
happens
to
be
superior
to
the
enemy
s
weakness
may
be
simulated
in
order
to
lure
him
on
but
if
inferior
he
must
be
led
to
believe
that
we
are
strong
in
order
that
he
may
keep
off
In
fact
all
the
enemy
s
movements
should
be
determined
by
the
signs
that
we
choose
to
give
him
Note
the
following
anecdote
of
Sun
Pin
a
descendent
of
Sun
Wu
In
B
C
the
Ch
i
State
being
at
war
with
Wei
sent
T
ien
Chi
and
Sun
Pin
against
the
general
P
ang
Chuan
who
happened
to
be
a
deadly
personal
enemy
of
the
later
Sun
Pin
said
The
Ch
i
State
has
a
reputation
for
cowardice
and
therefore
our
adversary
despises
us
Let
us
turn
this
circumstance
to
account
Accordingly
when
the
army
had
crossed
the
border
into
Wei
territory
he
gave
orders
to
show
fires
on
the
first
night
on
the
next
and
the
night
after
only
P
ang
Chuan
pursued
them
hotly
saying
to
himself
I
knew
these
men
of
Ch
i
were
cowards
their
numbers
have
already
fallen
away
by
more
than
half
In
his
retreat
Sun
Pin
came
to
a
narrow
defile
which
he
calculated
that
his
pursuers
would
reach
after
dark
Here
he
had
a
tree
stripped
of
its
bark
and
inscribed
upon
it
the
words
Under
this
tree
shall
P
ang
Chuan
die
Then
as
night
began
to
fall
he
placed
a
strong
body
of
archers
in
ambush
near
by
with
orders
to
shoot
directly
if
they
saw
a
light
Later
on
P
ang
Chuan
arrived
at
the
spot
and
noticing
the
tree
struck
a
light
in
order
to
read
what
was
written
on
it
His
body
was
immediately
riddled
by
a
volley
of
arrows
and
his
whole
army
thrown
into
confusion
The
above
is
Tu
Mu
s
version
of
the
story
the
Shih
Chi
less
dramatically
but
probably
with
more
historical
truth
makes
P
ang
Chuan
cut
his
own
throat
with
an
exclamation
of
despair
after
the
rout
of
his
army
He
sacrifices
something
that
the
enemy
may
snatch
at
it
By
holding
out
baits
he
keeps
him
on
the
march
then
with
a
body
of
picked
men
he
lies
in
wait
for
him
With
an
emendation
suggested
by
Li
Ching
this
then
reads
He
lies
in
wait
with
the
main
body
of
his
troops
The
clever
combatant
looks
to
the
effect
of
combined
energy
and
does
not
require
too
much
from
individuals
Tu
Mu
says
He
first
of
all
considers
the
power
of
his
army
in
the
bulk
afterwards
he
takes
individual
talent
into
account
and
uses
each
men
according
to
his
capabilities
He
does
not
demand
perfection
from
the
untalented
Hence
his
ability
to
pick
out
the
right
men
and
utilise
combined
energy
When
he
utilises
combined
energy
his
fighting
men
become
as
it
were
like
unto
rolling
logs
or
stones
For
it
is
the
nature
of
a
log
or
stone
to
remain
motionless
on
level
ground
and
to
move
when
on
a
slope
if
four
cornered
to
come
to
a
standstill
but
if
round
shaped
to
go
rolling
down
Ts
au
Kung
calls
this
the
use
of
natural
or
inherent
power
Thus
the
energy
developed
by
good
fighting
men
is
as
the
momentum
of
a
round
stone
rolled
down
a
mountain
thousands
of
feet
in
height
So
much
on
the
subject
of
energy
The
chief
lesson
of
this
chapter
in
Tu
Mu
s
opinion
is
the
paramount
importance
in
war
of
rapid
evolutions
and
sudden
rushes
Great
results
he
adds
can
thus
be
achieved
with
small
forces

Chapter
VI
WEAK
POINTS
AND
STRONG
Chang
Yu
attempts
to
explain
the
sequence
of
chapters
as
follows
Chapter
IV
on
Tactical
Dispositions
treated
of
the
offensive
and
the
defensive
chapter
V
on
Energy
dealt
with
direct
and
indirect
methods
The
good
general
acquaints
himself
first
with
the
theory
of
attack
and
defence
and
then
turns
his
attention
to
direct
and
indirect
methods
He
studies
the
art
of
varying
and
combining
these
two
methods
before
proceeding
to
the
subject
of
weak
and
strong
points
For
the
use
of
direct
or
indirect
methods
arises
out
of
attack
and
defence
and
the
perception
of
weak
and
strong
points
depends
again
on
the
above
methods
Hence
the
present
chapter
comes
immediately
after
the
chapter
on
Energy
Sun
Tzŭ
said
Whoever
is
first
in
the
field
and
awaits
the
coming
of
the
enemy
will
be
fresh
for
the
fight
whoever
is
second
in
the
field
and
has
to
hasten
to
battle
will
arrive
exhausted
Therefore
the
clever
combatant
imposes
his
will
on
the
enemy
but
does
not
allow
the
enemy
s
will
to
be
imposed
on
him
One
mark
of
a
great
soldier
is
that
he
fight
on
his
own
terms
or
fights
not
at
all
By
holding
out
advantages
to
him
he
can
cause
the
enemy
to
approach
of
his
own
accord
or
by
inflicting
damage
he
can
make
it
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
draw
near
In
the
first
case
he
will
entice
him
with
a
bait
in
the
second
he
will
strike
at
some
important
point
which
the
enemy
will
have
to
defend
If
the
enemy
is
taking
his
ease
he
can
harass
him
This
passage
may
be
cited
as
evidence
against
Mei
Yao
Ch
en
s
interpretation
of
I
if
well
supplied
with
food
he
can
starve
him
out
if
quietly
encamped
he
can
force
him
to
move
Appear
at
points
which
the
enemy
must
hasten
to
defend
march
swiftly
to
places
where
you
are
not
expected
An
army
may
march
great
distances
without
distress
if
it
marches
through
country
where
the
enemy
is
not
Ts
ao
Kung
sums
up
very
well
Emerge
from
the
void
q
d
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
strike
at
vulnerable
points
shun
places
that
are
defended
attack
in
unexpected
quarters
You
can
be
sure
of
succeeding
in
your
attacks
if
you
only
attack
places
which
are
undefended
Wang
Hsi
explains
undefended
places
as
weak
points
that
is
to
say
where
the
general
is
lacking
in
capacity
or
the
soldiers
in
spirit
where
the
walls
are
not
strong
enough
or
the
precautions
not
strict
enough
where
relief
comes
too
late
or
provisions
are
too
scanty
or
the
defenders
are
variance
amongst
themselves
You
can
ensure
the
safety
of
your
defence
if
you
only
hold
positions
that
cannot
be
attacked
I
e
where
there
are
none
of
the
weak
points
mentioned
above
There
is
rather
a
nice
point
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
this
later
clause
Tu
Mu
Ch
en
Hao
and
Mei
Yao
ch
en
assume
the
meaning
to
be
In
order
to
make
your
defence
quite
safe
you
must
defend
even
those
places
that
are
not
likely
to
be
attacked
and
Tu
Mu
adds
How
much
more
then
those
that
will
be
attacked
Taken
thus
however
the
clause
balances
less
well
with
the
preceding
always
a
consideration
in
the
highly
antithetical
style
which
is
natural
to
the
Chinese
Chang
Yu
therefore
seems
to
come
nearer
the
mark
in
saying
He
who
is
skilled
in
attack
flashes
forth
from
the
topmost
heights
of
heaven
see
IV
making
it
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
guard
against
him
This
being
so
the
places
that
I
shall
attack
are
precisely
those
that
the
enemy
cannot
defend
He
who
is
skilled
in
defence
hides
in
the
most
secret
recesses
of
the
earth
making
it
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
estimate
his
whereabouts
This
being
so
the
places
that
I
shall
hold
are
precisely
those
that
the
enemy
cannot
attack
Hence
that
general
is
skilful
in
attack
whose
opponent
does
not
know
what
to
defend
and
he
is
skilful
in
defence
whose
opponent
does
not
know
what
to
attack
An
aphorism
which
puts
the
whole
art
of
war
in
a
nutshell
O
divine
art
of
subtlety
and
secrecy
Through
you
we
learn
to
be
invisible
through
you
inaudible
Literally
without
form
or
sound
but
it
is
said
of
course
with
reference
to
the
enemy
and
hence
we
can
hold
the
enemy
s
fate
in
our
hands
You
may
advance
and
be
absolutely
irresistible
if
you
make
for
the
enemy
s
weak
points
you
may
retire
and
be
safe
from
pursuit
if
your
movements
are
more
rapid
than
those
of
the
enemy
If
we
wish
to
fight
the
enemy
can
be
forced
to
an
engagement
even
though
he
be
sheltered
behind
a
high
rampart
and
a
deep
ditch
All
we
need
do
is
attack
some
other
place
that
he
will
be
obliged
to
relieve
Tu
Mu
says
If
the
enemy
is
the
invading
party
we
can
cut
his
line
of
communications
and
occupy
the
roads
by
which
he
will
have
to
return
if
we
are
the
invaders
we
may
direct
our
attack
against
the
sovereign
himself
It
is
clear
that
Sun
Tzŭ
unlike
certain
generals
in
the
late
Boer
war
was
no
believer
in
frontal
attacks
If
we
do
not
wish
to
fight
we
can
prevent
the
enemy
from
engaging
us
even
though
the
lines
of
our
encampment
be
merely
traced
out
on
the
ground
All
we
need
do
is
to
throw
something
odd
and
unaccountable
in
his
way
This
extremely
concise
expression
is
intelligibly
paraphrased
by
Chia
Lin
even
though
we
have
constructed
neither
wall
nor
ditch
Li
Ch
uan
says
we
puzzle
him
by
strange
and
unusual
dispositions
and
Tu
Mu
finally
clinches
the
meaning
by
three
illustrative
anecdotes
one
of
Chu
ko
Liang
who
when
occupying
Yang
p
ing
and
about
to
be
attacked
by
Ssu
ma
I
suddenly
struck
his
colors
stopped
the
beating
of
the
drums
and
flung
open
the
city
gates
showing
only
a
few
men
engaged
in
sweeping
and
sprinkling
the
ground
This
unexpected
proceeding
had
the
intended
effect
for
Ssu
ma
I
suspecting
an
ambush
actually
drew
off
his
army
and
retreated
What
Sun
Tzŭ
is
advocating
here
therefore
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
timely
use
of
bluff
By
discovering
the
enemy
s
dispositions
and
remaining
invisible
ourselves
we
can
keep
our
forces
concentrated
while
the
enemy
s
must
be
divided
The
conclusion
is
perhaps
not
very
obvious
but
Chang
Yu
after
Mei
Yao
ch
en
rightly
explains
it
thus
If
the
enemy
s
dispositions
are
visible
we
can
make
for
him
in
one
body
whereas
our
own
dispositions
being
kept
secret
the
enemy
will
be
obliged
to
divide
his
forces
in
order
to
guard
against
attack
from
every
quarter
We
can
form
a
single
united
body
while
the
enemy
must
split
up
into
fractions
Hence
there
will
be
a
whole
pitted
against
separate
parts
of
a
whole
which
means
that
we
shall
be
many
to
the
enemy
s
few
And
if
we
are
able
thus
to
attack
an
inferior
force
with
a
superior
one
our
opponents
will
be
in
dire
straits
The
spot
where
we
intend
to
fight
must
not
be
made
known
for
then
the
enemy
will
have
to
prepare
against
a
possible
attack
at
several
different
points
Sheridan
once
explained
the
reason
of
General
Grant
s
victories
by
saying
that
while
his
opponents
were
kept
fully
employed
wondering
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
was
thinking
most
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
himself
and
his
forces
being
thus
distributed
in
many
directions
the
numbers
we
shall
have
to
face
at
any
given
point
will
be
proportionately
few
For
should
the
enemy
strengthen
his
van
he
will
weaken
his
rear
should
he
strengthen
his
rear
he
will
weaken
his
van
should
he
strengthen
his
left
he
will
weaken
his
right
should
he
strengthen
his
right
he
will
weaken
his
left
If
he
sends
reinforcements
everywhere
he
will
everywhere
be
weak
In
Frederick
the
Great
s
Instructions
to
his
Generals
we
read
A
defensive
war
is
apt
to
betray
us
into
too
frequent
detachment
Those
generals
who
have
had
but
little
experience
attempt
to
protect
every
point
while
those
who
are
better
acquainted
with
their
profession
having
only
the
capital
object
in
view
guard
against
a
decisive
blow
and
acquiesce
in
small
misfortunes
to
avoid
greater
Numerical
weakness
comes
from
having
to
prepare
against
possible
attacks
numerical
strength
from
compelling
our
adversary
to
make
these
preparations
against
us
The
highest
generalship
in
Col
Henderson
s
words
is
to
compel
the
enemy
to
disperse
his
army
and
then
to
concentrate
superior
force
against
each
fraction
in
turn
Knowing
the
place
and
the
time
of
the
coming
battle
we
may
concentrate
from
the
greatest
distances
in
order
to
fight
What
Sun
Tzŭ
evidently
has
in
mind
is
that
nice
calculation
of
distances
and
that
masterly
employment
of
strategy
which
enable
a
general
to
divide
his
army
for
the
purpose
of
a
long
and
rapid
march
and
afterwards
to
effect
a
junction
at
precisely
the
right
spot
and
the
right
hour
in
order
to
confront
the
enemy
in
overwhelming
strength
Among
many
such
successful
junctions
which
military
history
records
one
of
the
most
dramatic
and
decisive
was
the
appearance
of
Blucher
just
at
the
critical
moment
on
the
field
of
Waterloo
But
if
neither
time
nor
place
be
known
then
the
left
wing
will
be
impotent
to
succour
the
right
the
right
equally
impotent
to
succour
the
left
the
van
unable
to
relieve
the
rear
or
the
rear
to
support
the
van
How
much
more
so
if
the
furthest
portions
of
the
army
are
anything
under
a
hundred
li
apart
and
even
the
nearest
are
separated
by
several
li
The
Chinese
of
this
last
sentence
is
a
little
lacking
in
precision
but
the
mental
picture
we
are
required
to
draw
is
probably
that
of
an
army
advancing
towards
a
given
rendezvous
in
separate
columns
each
of
which
has
orders
to
be
there
on
a
fixed
date
If
the
general
allows
the
various
detachments
to
proceed
at
haphazard
without
precise
instructions
as
to
the
time
and
place
of
meeting
the
enemy
will
be
able
to
annihilate
the
army
in
detail
Chang
Yu
s
note
may
be
worth
quoting
here
If
we
do
not
know
the
place
where
our
opponents
mean
to
concentrate
or
the
day
on
which
they
will
join
battle
our
unity
will
be
forfeited
through
our
preparations
for
defence
and
the
positions
we
hold
will
be
insecure
Suddenly
happening
upon
a
powerful
foe
we
shall
be
brought
to
battle
in
a
flurried
condition
and
no
mutual
support
will
be
possible
between
wings
vanguard
or
rear
especially
if
there
is
any
great
distance
between
the
foremost
and
hindmost
divisions
of
the
army
Though
according
to
my
estimate
the
soldiers
of
Yüeh
exceed
our
own
in
number
that
shall
advantage
them
nothing
in
the
matter
of
victory
I
say
then
that
victory
can
be
achieved
Alas
for
these
brave
words
The
long
feud
between
the
two
states
ended
in
B
C
with
the
total
defeat
of
Wu
by
Kou
Chien
and
its
incorporation
in
Yüeh
This
was
doubtless
long
after
Sun
Tzŭ
s
death
With
his
present
assertion
compare
IV
Chang
Yu
is
the
only
one
to
point
out
the
seeming
discrepancy
which
he
thus
goes
on
to
explain
In
the
chapter
on
Tactical
Dispositions
it
is
said
One
may
know
how
to
conquer
without
being
able
to
do
it
whereas
here
we
have
the
statement
that
victory
can
be
achieved
The
explanation
is
that
in
the
former
chapter
where
the
offensive
and
defensive
are
under
discussion
it
is
said
that
if
the
enemy
is
fully
prepared
one
cannot
make
certain
of
beating
him
But
the
present
passage
refers
particularly
to
the
soldiers
of
Yüeh
who
according
to
Sun
Tzŭ
s
calculations
will
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
time
and
place
of
the
impending
struggle
That
is
why
he
says
here
that
victory
can
be
achieved
Though
the
enemy
be
stronger
in
numbers
we
may
prevent
him
from
fighting
Scheme
so
as
to
discover
his
plans
and
the
likelihood
of
their
success
An
alternative
reading
offered
by
Chia
Lin
is
Know
beforehand
all
plans
conducive
to
our
success
and
to
the
enemy
s
failure
Rouse
him
and
learn
the
principle
of
his
activity
or
inactivity
Chang
Yu
tells
us
that
by
noting
the
joy
or
anger
shown
by
the
enemy
on
being
thus
disturbed
we
shall
be
able
to
conclude
whether
his
policy
is
to
lie
low
or
the
reverse
He
instances
the
action
of
Cho
ku
Liang
who
sent
the
scornful
present
of
a
woman
s
head
dress
to
Ssu
ma
I
in
order
to
goad
him
out
of
his
Fabian
tactics
Force
him
to
reveal
himself
so
as
to
find
out
his
vulnerable
spots
Carefully
compare
the
opposing
army
with
your
own
so
that
you
may
know
where
strength
is
superabundant
and
where
it
is
deficient
Cf
IV
In
making
tactical
dispositions
the
highest
pitch
you
can
attain
is
to
conceal
them
The
piquancy
of
the
paradox
evaporates
in
translation
Concealment
is
perhaps
not
so
much
actual
invisibility
see
supra
as
showing
no
sign
of
what
you
mean
to
do
of
the
plans
that
are
formed
in
your
brain
conceal
your
dispositions
and
you
will
be
safe
from
the
prying
of
the
subtlest
spies
from
the
machinations
of
the
wisest
brains
Tu
Mu
explains
Though
the
enemy
may
have
clever
and
capable
officers
they
will
not
be
able
to
lay
any
plans
against
us
How
victory
may
be
produced
for
them
out
of
the
enemy
s
own
tactics
that
is
what
the
multitude
cannot
comprehend
All
men
can
see
the
tactics
whereby
I
conquer
but
what
none
can
see
is
the
strategy
out
of
which
victory
is
evolved
I
e
everybody
can
see
superficially
how
a
battle
is
won
what
they
cannot
see
is
the
long
series
of
plans
and
combinations
which
has
preceded
the
battle
Do
not
repeat
the
tactics
which
have
gained
you
one
victory
but
let
your
methods
be
regulated
by
the
infinite
variety
of
circumstances
As
Wang
Hsi
sagely
remarks
There
is
but
one
root
principle
underlying
victory
but
the
tactics
which
lead
up
to
it
are
infinite
in
number
With
this
compare
Col
Henderson
The
rules
of
strategy
are
few
and
simple
They
may
be
learned
in
a
week
They
may
be
taught
by
familiar
illustrations
or
a
dozen
diagrams
But
such
knowledge
will
no
more
teach
a
man
to
lead
an
army
like
Napoleon
than
a
knowledge
of
grammar
will
teach
him
to
write
like
Gibbon
Military
tactics
are
like
unto
water
for
water
in
its
natural
course
runs
away
from
high
places
and
hastens
downwards
So
in
war
the
way
is
to
avoid
what
is
strong
and
to
strike
at
what
is
weak
Like
water
taking
the
line
of
least
resistance
Water
shapes
its
course
according
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
over
which
it
flows
the
soldier
works
out
his
victory
in
relation
to
the
foe
whom
he
is
facing
Therefore
just
as
water
retains
no
constant
shape
so
in
warfare
there
are
no
constant
conditions
He
who
can
modify
his
tactics
in
relation
to
his
opponent
and
thereby
succeed
in
winning
may
be
called
a
heaven
born
captain
The
five
elements
water
fire
wood
metal
earth
are
not
always
equally
predominant
That
is
as
Wang
Hsi
says
they
predominate
alternately
the
four
seasons
make
way
for
each
other
in
turn
Literally
have
no
invariable
seat
There
are
short
days
and
long
the
moon
has
its
periods
of
waning
and
waxing
Cf
V
The
purport
of
the
passage
is
simply
to
illustrate
the
want
of
fixity
in
war
by
the
changes
constantly
taking
place
in
Nature
The
comparison
is
not
very
happy
however
because
the
regularity
of
the
phenomena
which
Sun
Tzŭ
mentions
is
by
no
means
paralleled
in
war

Col
Henderson

biography
of

MANŒUVERING
Sun
Tzŭ
said
In
war
the
general
receives
his
commands
from
the
sovereign
Having
collected
an
army
and
concentrated
his
forces
he
must
blend
and
harmonise
the
different
elements
thereof
before
pitching
his
camp
Chang
Yu
says
the
establishment
of
harmony
and
confidence
between
the
higher
and
lower
ranks
before
venturing
into
the
field
and
he
quotes
a
saying
of
Wu
Tzŭ
chap
ad
init
Without
harmony
in
the
State
no
military
expedition
can
be
undertaken
without
harmony
in
the
army
no
battle
array
can
be
formed
In
an
historical
romance
Sun
Tzŭ
is
represented
as
saying
to
Wu
Yuan
As
a
general
rule
those
who
are
waging
war
should
get
rid
of
all
the
domestic
troubles
before
proceeding
to
attack
the
external
foe
After
that
comes
tactical
manœuvering
than
which
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
I
have
departed
slightly
from
the
traditional
interpretation
of
Ts
ao
Kung
who
says
From
the
time
of
receiving
the
sovereign
s
instructions
until
our
encampment
over
against
the
enemy
the
tactics
to
be
pursued
are
most
difficult
It
seems
to
me
that
the
tactics
or
manœuvers
can
hardly
be
said
to
begin
until
the
army
has
sallied
forth
and
encamped
and
Ch
ien
Hao
s
note
gives
color
to
this
view
For
levying
concentrating
harmonizing
and
entrenching
an
army
there
are
plenty
of
old
rules
which
will
serve
The
real
difficulty
comes
when
we
engage
in
tactical
operations
Tu
Yu
also
observes
that
the
great
difficulty
is
to
be
beforehand
with
the
enemy
in
seizing
favourable
position
The
difficulty
of
tactical
manœuvering
consists
in
turning
the
devious
into
the
direct
and
misfortune
into
gain
This
sentence
contains
one
of
those
highly
condensed
and
somewhat
enigmatical
expressions
of
which
Sun
Tzŭ
is
so
fond
This
is
how
it
is
explained
by
Ts
ao
Kung
Make
it
appear
that
you
are
a
long
way
off
then
cover
the
distance
rapidly
and
arrive
on
the
scene
before
your
opponent
Tu
Mu
says
Hoodwink
the
enemy
so
that
he
may
be
remiss
and
leisurely
while
you
are
dashing
along
with
utmost
speed
Ho
Shih
gives
a
slightly
different
turn
Although
you
may
have
difficult
ground
to
traverse
and
natural
obstacles
to
encounter
this
is
a
drawback
which
can
be
turned
into
actual
advantage
by
celerity
of
movement
Signal
examples
of
this
saying
are
afforded
by
the
two
famous
passages
across
the
Alps
that
of
Hannibal
which
laid
Italy
at
his
mercy
and
that
of
Napoleon
two
thousand
years
later
which
resulted
in
the
great
victory
of
Marengo
Thus
to
take
a
long
and
circuitous
route
after
enticing
the
enemy
out
of
the
way
and
though
starting
after
him
to
contrive
to
reach
the
goal
before
him
shows
knowledge
of
the
artifice
of
deviation
Tu
Mu
cites
the
famous
march
of
Chao
She
in
B
C
to
relieve
the
town
of
O
yu
which
was
closely
invested
by
a
Ch
in
army
The
King
of
Chao
first
consulted
Lien
P
o
on
the
advisability
of
attempting
a
relief
but
the
latter
thought
the
distance
too
great
and
the
intervening
country
too
rugged
and
difficult
His
Majesty
then
turned
to
Chao
She
who
fully
admitted
the
hazardous
nature
of
the
march
but
finally
said
We
shall
be
like
two
rats
fighting
in
a
whole
and
the
pluckier
one
will
win
So
he
left
the
capital
with
his
army
but
had
only
gone
a
distance
of
li
when
he
stopped
and
began
throwing
up
entrenchments
For
days
he
continued
strengthening
his
fortifications
and
took
care
that
spies
should
carry
the
intelligence
to
the
enemy
The
Ch
in
general
was
overjoyed
and
attributed
his
adversary
s
tardiness
to
the
fact
that
the
beleaguered
city
was
in
the
Han
State
and
thus
not
actually
part
of
Chao
territory
But
the
spies
had
no
sooner
departed
than
Chao
She
began
a
forced
march
lasting
for
two
days
and
one
night
and
arrive
on
the
scene
of
action
with
such
astonishing
rapidity
that
he
was
able
to
occupy
a
commanding
position
on
the
North
hill
before
the
enemy
had
got
wind
of
his
movements
A
crushing
defeat
followed
for
the
Ch
in
forces
who
were
obliged
to
raise
the
siege
of
O
yu
in
all
haste
and
retreat
across
the
border
Manœuvering
with
an
army
is
advantageous
with
an
undisciplined
multitude
most
dangerous
I
adopt
the
reading
of
the
T
ung
Tien
Cheng
Yu
hsien
and
the
T
u
Shu
since
they
appear
to
apply
the
exact
nuance
required
in
order
to
make
sense
The
commentators
using
the
standard
text
take
this
line
to
mean
that
manœuvers
may
be
profitable
or
they
may
be
dangerous
it
all
depends
on
the
ability
of
the
general
If
you
set
a
fully
equipped
army
in
march
in
order
to
snatch
an
advantage
the
chances
are
that
you
will
be
too
late
On
the
other
hand
to
detach
a
flying
column
for
the
purpose
involves
the
sacrifice
of
its
baggage
and
stores
Some
of
the
Chinese
text
is
unintelligible
to
the
Chinese
commentators
who
paraphrase
the
sentence
I
submit
my
own
rendering
without
much
enthusiasm
being
convinced
that
there
is
some
deep
seated
corruption
in
the
text
On
the
whole
it
is
clear
that
Sun
Tzŭ
does
not
approve
of
a
lengthy
march
being
undertaken
without
supplies
Cf
infra
Thus
if
you
order
your
men
to
roll
up
their
buff
coats
and
make
forced
marches
without
halting
day
or
night
covering
double
the
usual
distance
at
a
stretch
The
ordinary
day
s
march
according
to
Tu
Mu
was
li
but
on
one
occasion
when
pursuing
Liu
Pei
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
is
said
to
have
covered
the
incredible
distance
of
li
within
twenty
four
hours
doing
a
hundred
li
in
order
to
wrest
an
advantage
the
leaders
of
all
your
three
divisions
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
The
stronger
men
will
be
in
front
the
jaded
ones
will
fall
behind
and
on
this
plan
only
one
tenth
of
your
army
will
reach
its
destination
The
moral
is
as
Ts
ao
Kung
and
others
point
out
Don
t
march
a
hundred
li
to
gain
a
tactical
advantage
either
with
or
without
impedimenta
Manœuvers
of
this
description
should
be
confined
to
short
distances
Stonewall
Jackson
said
The
hardships
of
forced
marches
are
often
more
painful
than
the
dangers
of
battle
He
did
not
often
call
upon
his
troops
for
extraordinary
exertions
It
was
only
when
he
intended
a
surprise
or
when
a
rapid
retreat
was
imperative
that
he
sacrificed
everything
for
speed
If
you
march
fifty
li
in
order
to
outmanœuver
the
enemy
you
will
lose
the
leader
of
your
first
division
and
only
half
your
force
will
reach
the
goal
Literally
the
leader
of
the
first
division
will
be
torn
away
If
you
march
thirty
li
with
the
same
object
two
thirds
of
your
army
will
arrive
In
the
T
ung
Tien
is
added
From
this
we
may
know
the
difficulty
of
manœuvering
We
may
take
it
then
that
an
army
without
its
baggage
train
is
lost
without
provisions
it
is
lost
without
bases
of
supply
it
is
lost
I
think
Sun
Tzŭ
meant
stores
accumulated
in
dépôts
But
Tu
Yu
says
fodder
and
the
like
Chang
Yu
says
Goods
in
general
and
Wang
Hsi
says
fuel
salt
foodstuffs
etc
We
cannot
enter
into
alliances
until
we
are
acquainted
with
the
designs
of
our
neighbours
We
are
not
fit
to
lead
an
army
on
the
march
unless
we
are
familiar
with
the
face
of
the
country
its
mountains
and
forests
its
pitfalls
and
precipices
its
marshes
and
swamps
We
shall
be
unable
to
turn
natural
advantages
to
account
unless
we
make
use
of
local
guides
are
repeated
in
chap
XI
In
war
practise
dissimulation
and
you
will
succeed
In
the
tactics
of
Turenne
deception
of
the
enemy
especially
as
to
the
numerical
strength
of
his
troops
took
a
very
prominent
position
Move
only
if
there
is
a
real
advantage
to
be
gained
Whether
to
concentrate
or
to
divide
your
troops
must
be
decided
by
circumstances
Let
your
rapidity
be
that
of
the
wind
The
simile
is
doubly
appropriate
because
the
wind
is
not
only
swift
but
as
Mei
Yao
ch
en
points
out
invisible
and
leaves
no
tracks
your
compactness
that
of
the
forest
Meng
Shih
comes
nearer
to
the
mark
in
his
note
When
slowly
marching
order
and
ranks
must
be
preserved
so
as
to
guard
against
surprise
attacks
But
natural
forest
do
not
grow
in
rows
whereas
they
do
generally
possess
the
quality
of
density
or
compactness
In
raiding
and
plundering
be
like
fire
Cf
Shih
Ching
IV
iv
Fierce
as
a
blazing
fire
which
no
man
can
check
in
immovability
like
a
mountain
That
is
when
holding
a
position
from
which
the
enemy
is
trying
to
dislodge
you
or
perhaps
as
Tu
Yu
says
when
he
is
trying
to
entice
you
into
a
trap
Let
your
plans
be
dark
and
impenetrable
as
night
and
when
you
move
fall
like
a
thunderbolt
Tu
Yu
quotes
a
saying
of
T
ai
Kung
which
has
passed
into
a
proverb
You
cannot
shut
your
ears
to
the
thunder
or
your
eyes
to
the
lighting
so
rapid
are
they
Likewise
an
attack
should
be
made
so
quickly
that
it
cannot
be
parried
When
you
plunder
a
countryside
let
the
spoil
be
divided
amongst
your
men
Sun
Tzŭ
wishes
to
lessen
the
abuses
of
indiscriminate
plundering
by
insisting
that
all
booty
shall
be
thrown
into
a
common
stock
which
may
afterwards
be
fairly
divided
amongst
all
when
you
capture
new
territory
cut
it
up
into
allotments
for
the
benefit
of
the
soldiery
Ch
en
Hao
says
quarter
your
soldiers
on
the
land
and
let
them
sow
and
plant
it
It
is
by
acting
on
this
principle
and
harvesting
the
lands
they
invaded
that
the
Chinese
have
succeeded
in
carrying
out
some
of
their
most
memorable
and
triumphant
expeditions
such
as
that
of
Pan
Ch
ao
who
penetrated
to
the
Caspian
and
in
more
recent
years
those
of
Fu
k
ang
an
and
Tso
Tsung
t
ang
Ponder
and
deliberate
before
you
make
a
move
Chang
Yu
quotes
Wei
Liao
Tzŭ
as
saying
that
we
must
not
break
camp
until
we
have
gained
the
resisting
power
of
the
enemy
and
the
cleverness
of
the
opposing
general
Cf
the
seven
comparisons
in
I
He
will
conquer
who
has
learnt
the
artifice
of
deviation
See
supra
Such
is
the
art
of
manœuvering
With
these
words
the
chapter
would
naturally
come
to
an
end
But
there
now
follows
a
long
appendix
in
the
shape
of
an
extract
from
an
earlier
book
on
War
now
lost
but
apparently
extant
at
the
time
when
Sun
Tzŭ
wrote
The
style
of
this
fragment
is
not
noticeably
different
from
that
of
Sun
Tzŭ
himself
but
no
commentator
raises
a
doubt
as
to
its
genuineness
The
Book
of
Army
Management
says
It
is
perhaps
significant
that
none
of
the
earlier
commentators
give
us
any
information
about
this
work
Mei
Yao
Ch
en
calls
it
an
ancient
military
classic
and
Wang
Hsi
an
old
book
on
war
Considering
the
enormous
amount
of
fighting
that
had
gone
on
for
centuries
before
Sun
Tzŭ
s
time
between
the
various
kingdoms
and
principalities
of
China
it
is
not
in
itself
improbable
that
a
collection
of
military
maxims
should
have
been
made
and
written
down
at
some
earlier
period
On
the
field
of
battle
Implied
though
not
actually
in
the
Chinese
the
spoken
word
does
not
carry
far
enough
hence
the
institution
of
gongs
and
drums
Nor
can
ordinary
objects
be
seen
clearly
enough
hence
the
institution
of
banners
and
flags
Gongs
and
drums
banners
and
flags
are
means
whereby
the
ears
and
eyes
of
the
host
may
be
focussed
on
one
particular
point
Chang
Yu
says
If
sight
and
hearing
converge
simultaneously
on
the
same
object
the
evolutions
of
as
many
as
a
million
soldiers
will
be
like
those
of
a
single
man
The
host
thus
forming
a
single
united
body
is
it
impossible
either
for
the
brave
to
advance
alone
or
for
the
cowardly
to
retreat
alone
Chuang
Yu
quotes
a
saying
Equally
guilty
are
those
who
advance
against
orders
and
those
who
retreat
against
orders
Tu
Mu
tells
a
story
in
this
connection
of
Wu
Ch
i
when
he
was
fighting
against
the
Ch
in
State
Before
the
battle
had
begun
one
of
his
soldiers
a
man
of
matchless
daring
sallied
forth
by
himself
captured
two
heads
from
the
enemy
and
returned
to
camp
Wu
Ch
i
had
the
man
instantly
executed
whereupon
an
officer
ventured
to
remonstrate
saying
This
man
was
a
good
soldier
and
ought
not
to
have
been
beheaded
Wu
Ch
i
replied
I
fully
believe
he
was
a
good
soldier
but
I
had
him
beheaded
because
he
acted
without
orders
This
is
the
art
of
handling
large
masses
of
men
In
night
fighting
then
make
much
use
of
signal
fires
and
drums
and
in
fighting
by
day
of
flags
and
banners
as
a
means
of
influencing
the
ears
and
eyes
of
your
army
Ch
en
Hao
alludes
to
Li
Kuang
pi
s
night
ride
to
Ho
yang
at
the
head
of
mounted
men
they
made
such
an
imposing
display
with
torches
that
though
the
rebel
leader
Shih
Ssu
ming
had
a
large
army
he
did
not
dare
to
dispute
their
passage
A
whole
army
may
be
robbed
of
its
spirit
In
war
says
Chang
Yu
if
a
spirit
of
anger
can
be
made
to
pervade
all
ranks
of
an
army
at
one
and
the
same
time
its
onset
will
be
irresistible
Now
the
spirit
of
the
enemy
s
soldiers
will
be
keenest
when
they
have
newly
arrived
on
the
scene
and
it
is
therefore
our
cue
not
to
fight
at
once
but
to
wait
until
their
ardor
and
enthusiasm
have
worn
off
and
then
strike
It
is
in
this
way
that
they
may
be
robbed
of
their
keen
spirit
Li
Ch
uan
and
others
tell
an
anecdote
to
be
found
in
the
Tso
Chuan
year
of
Ts
ao
Kuei
a
protege
of
Duke
Chuang
of
Lu
The
latter
State
was
attacked
by
Ch
i
and
the
duke
was
about
to
join
battle
at
Ch
ang
cho
after
the
first
roll
of
the
enemy
s
drums
when
Ts
ao
said
Not
just
yet
Only
after
their
drums
had
beaten
for
the
third
time
did
he
give
the
word
for
attack
Then
they
fought
and
the
men
of
Ch
i
were
utterly
defeated
Questioned
afterwards
by
the
Duke
as
to
the
meaning
of
his
delay
Ts
ao
Kuei
replied
In
battle
a
courageous
spirit
is
everything
Now
the
first
roll
of
the
drum
tends
to
create
this
spirit
but
with
the
second
it
is
already
on
the
wane
and
after
the
third
it
is
gone
altogether
I
attacked
when
their
spirit
was
gone
and
ours
was
at
its
height
Hence
our
victory
Wu
Tzŭ
chap
puts
spirit
first
among
the
four
important
influences
in
war
and
continues
The
value
of
a
whole
army
a
mighty
host
of
a
million
men
is
dependent
on
one
man
alone
such
is
the
influence
of
spirit
a
commander
in
chief
may
be
robbed
of
his
presence
of
mind
Chang
Yu
says
Presence
of
mind
is
the
general
s
most
important
asset
It
is
the
quality
which
enables
him
to
discipline
disorder
and
to
inspire
courage
into
the
panic
stricken
The
great
general
Li
Ching
A
D
has
a
saying
Attacking
does
not
merely
consist
in
assaulting
walled
cities
or
striking
at
an
army
in
battle
array
it
must
include
the
art
of
assailing
the
enemy
s
mental
equilibrium
Now
a
soldier
s
spirit
is
keenest
in
the
morning
Always
provided
I
suppose
that
he
has
had
breakfast
At
the
battle
of
the
Trebia
the
Romans
were
foolishly
allowed
to
fight
fasting
whereas
Hannibal
s
men
had
breakfasted
at
their
leisure
See
Livy
XXI
liv
lv
and
by
noonday
it
has
begun
to
flag
and
in
the
evening
his
mind
is
bent
only
on
returning
to
camp
A
clever
general
therefore
avoids
an
army
when
its
spirit
is
keen
but
attacks
it
when
it
is
sluggish
and
inclined
to
return
This
is
the
art
of
studying
moods
Disciplined
and
calm
to
await
the
appearance
of
disorder
and
hubbub
amongst
the
enemy
this
is
the
art
of
retaining
self
possession
To
be
near
the
goal
while
the
enemy
is
still
far
from
it
to
wait
at
ease
while
the
enemy
is
toiling
and
struggling
to
be
well
fed
while
the
enemy
is
famished
this
is
the
art
of
husbanding
one
s
strength
To
refrain
from
intercepting
an
enemy
whose
banners
are
in
perfect
order
to
refrain
from
attacking
an
army
drawn
up
in
calm
and
confident
array
this
is
the
art
of
studying
circumstances
It
is
a
military
axiom
not
to
advance
uphill
against
the
enemy
nor
to
oppose
him
when
he
comes
downhill
Do
not
pursue
an
enemy
who
simulates
flight
do
not
attack
soldiers
whose
temper
is
keen
Do
not
swallow
a
bait
offered
by
the
enemy
Li
Ch
uan
and
Tu
Mu
with
extraordinary
inability
to
see
a
metaphor
take
these
words
quite
literally
of
food
and
drink
that
have
been
poisoned
by
the
enemy
Ch
en
Hao
and
Chang
Yu
carefully
point
out
that
the
saying
has
a
wider
application
Do
not
interfere
with
an
army
that
is
returning
home
The
commentators
explain
this
rather
singular
piece
of
advice
by
saying
that
a
man
whose
heart
is
set
on
returning
home
will
fight
to
the
death
against
any
attempt
to
bar
his
way
and
is
therefore
too
dangerous
an
opponent
to
be
tackled
Chang
Yu
quotes
the
words
of
Han
Hsin
Invincible
is
the
soldier
who
hath
his
desire
and
returneth
homewards
A
marvelous
tale
is
told
of
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
s
courage
and
resource
in
ch
of
the
San
Kuo
Chi
In
A
D
he
was
besieging
Chang
Hsiu
in
Jang
when
Liu
Piao
sent
reinforcements
with
a
view
to
cutting
off
Ts
ao
s
retreat
The
latter
was
obliged
to
draw
off
his
troops
only
to
find
himself
hemmed
in
between
two
enemies
who
were
guarding
each
outlet
of
a
narrow
pass
in
which
he
had
engaged
himself
In
this
desperate
plight
Ts
ao
waited
until
nightfall
when
he
bored
a
tunnel
into
the
mountain
side
and
laid
an
ambush
in
it
As
soon
as
the
whole
army
had
passed
by
the
hidden
troops
fell
on
his
rear
while
Ts
ao
himself
turned
and
met
his
pursuers
in
front
so
that
they
were
thrown
into
confusion
and
annihilated
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
said
afterwards
The
brigands
tried
to
check
my
army
in
its
retreat
and
brought
me
to
battle
in
a
desperate
position
hence
I
knew
how
to
overcome
them
When
you
surround
an
army
leave
an
outlet
free
This
does
not
mean
that
the
enemy
is
to
be
allowed
to
escape
The
object
as
Tu
Mu
puts
it
is
to
make
him
believe
that
there
is
a
road
to
safety
and
thus
prevent
his
fighting
with
the
courage
of
despair
Tu
Mu
adds
pleasantly
After
that
you
may
crush
him
Do
not
press
a
desperate
foe
too
hard
Ch
en
Hao
quotes
the
saying
Birds
and
beasts
when
brought
to
bay
will
use
their
claws
and
teeth
Chang
Yu
says
If
your
adversary
has
burned
his
boats
and
destroyed
his
cooking
pots
and
is
ready
to
stake
all
on
the
issue
of
a
battle
he
must
not
be
pushed
to
extremities
Ho
Shih
illustrates
the
meaning
by
a
story
taken
from
the
life
of
Yen
ch
ing
That
general
together
with
his
colleague
Tu
Chung
wei
was
surrounded
by
a
vastly
superior
army
of
Khitans
in
the
year
A
D
The
country
was
bare
and
desert
like
and
the
little
Chinese
force
was
soon
in
dire
straits
for
want
of
water
The
wells
they
bored
ran
dry
and
the
men
were
reduced
to
squeezing
lumps
of
mud
and
sucking
out
the
moisture
Their
ranks
thinned
rapidly
until
at
last
Fu
Yen
ch
ing
exclaimed
We
are
desperate
men
Far
better
to
die
for
our
country
than
to
go
with
fettered
hands
into
captivity
A
strong
gale
happened
to
be
blowing
from
the
northeast
and
darkening
the
air
with
dense
clouds
of
sandy
dust
To
Chung
wei
was
for
waiting
until
this
had
abated
before
deciding
on
a
final
attack
but
luckily
another
officer
Li
Shou
cheng
by
name
was
quicker
to
see
an
opportunity
and
said
They
are
many
and
we
are
few
but
in
the
midst
of
this
sandstorm
our
numbers
will
not
be
discernible
victory
will
go
to
the
strenuous
fighter
and
the
wind
will
be
our
best
ally
Accordingly
Fu
Yen
ch
ing
made
a
sudden
and
wholly
unexpected
onslaught
with
his
cavalry
routed
the
barbarians
and
succeeded
in
breaking
through
to
safety
Such
is
the
art
of
warfare

VARIATION
OF
TACTICS
The
heading
means
literally
The
Nine
Variations
but
as
Sun
Tzŭ
does
not
appear
to
enumerate
these
and
as
indeed
he
has
already
told
us
V
that
such
deflections
from
the
ordinary
course
are
practically
innumerable
we
have
little
option
but
to
follow
Wang
Hsi
who
says
that
Nine
stands
for
an
indefinitely
large
number
All
it
means
is
that
in
warfare
we
ought
to
vary
our
tactics
to
the
utmost
degree
I
do
not
know
what
Ts
ao
Kung
makes
these
Nine
Variations
out
to
be
but
it
has
been
suggested
that
they
are
connected
with
the
Nine
Situations
of
chapt
XI
This
is
the
view
adopted
by
Chang
Yu
The
only
other
alternative
is
to
suppose
that
something
has
been
lost
a
supposition
to
which
the
unusual
shortness
of
the
chapter
lends
some
weight
Sun
Tzŭ
said
In
war
the
general
receives
his
commands
from
the
sovereign
collects
his
army
and
concentrates
his
forces
Repeated
from
VII
where
it
is
certainly
more
in
place
It
may
have
been
interpolated
here
merely
in
order
to
supply
a
beginning
to
the
chapter
When
in
difficult
country
do
not
encamp
In
country
where
high
roads
intersect
join
hands
with
your
allies
Do
not
linger
in
dangerously
isolated
positions
The
last
situation
is
not
one
of
the
Nine
Situations
as
given
in
the
beginning
of
chap
XI
but
occurs
later
on
ibid
q
v
Chang
Yu
defines
this
situation
as
being
situated
across
the
frontier
in
hostile
territory
Li
Ch
uan
says
it
is
country
in
which
there
are
no
springs
or
wells
flocks
or
herds
vegetables
or
firewood
Chia
Lin
one
of
gorges
chasms
and
precipices
without
a
road
by
which
to
advance
In
hemmed
in
situations
you
must
resort
to
stratagem
In
a
desperate
position
you
must
fight
There
are
roads
which
must
not
be
followed
Especially
those
leading
through
narrow
defiles
says
Li
Ch
uan
where
an
ambush
is
to
be
feared
armies
which
must
be
not
attacked
More
correctly
perhaps
there
are
times
when
an
army
must
not
be
attacked
Ch
en
Hao
says
When
you
see
your
way
to
obtain
a
rival
advantage
but
are
powerless
to
inflict
a
real
defeat
refrain
from
attacking
for
fear
of
overtaxing
your
men
s
strength
towns
which
must
not
be
besieged
Cf
III
Ts
ao
Kung
gives
an
interesting
illustration
from
his
own
experience
When
invading
the
territory
of
Hsu
chou
he
ignored
the
city
of
Hua
pi
which
lay
directly
in
his
path
and
pressed
on
into
the
heart
of
the
country
This
excellent
strategy
was
rewarded
by
the
subsequent
capture
of
no
fewer
than
fourteen
important
district
cities
Chang
Yu
says
No
town
should
be
attacked
which
if
taken
cannot
be
held
or
if
left
alone
will
not
cause
any
trouble
Hsun
Ying
when
urged
to
attack
Pi
yang
replied
The
city
is
small
and
well
fortified
even
if
I
succeed
intaking
it
it
will
be
no
great
feat
of
arms
whereas
if
I
fail
I
shall
make
myself
a
laughing
stock
In
the
seventeenth
century
sieges
still
formed
a
large
proportion
of
war
It
was
Turenne
who
directed
attention
to
the
importance
of
marches
countermarches
and
manœuvers
He
said
It
is
a
great
mistake
to
waste
men
in
taking
a
town
when
the
same
expenditure
of
soldiers
will
gain
a
province
positions
which
must
not
be
contested
commands
of
the
sovereign
which
must
not
be
obeyed
This
is
a
hard
saying
for
the
Chinese
with
their
reverence
for
authority
and
Wei
Liao
Tzŭ
quoted
by
Tu
Mu
is
moved
to
exclaim
Weapons
are
baleful
instruments
strife
is
antagonistic
to
virtue
a
military
commander
is
the
negation
of
civil
order
The
unpalatable
fact
remains
however
that
even
Imperial
wishes
must
be
subordinated
to
military
necessity
The
general
who
thoroughly
understands
the
advantages
that
accompany
variation
of
tactics
knows
how
to
handle
his
troops
The
general
who
does
not
understand
these
may
be
well
acquainted
with
the
configuration
of
the
country
yet
he
will
not
be
able
to
turn
his
knowledge
to
practical
account
Literally
get
the
advantage
of
the
ground
which
means
not
only
securing
good
positions
but
availing
oneself
of
natural
advantages
in
every
possible
way
Chang
Yu
says
Every
kind
of
ground
is
characterized
by
certain
natural
features
and
also
gives
scope
for
a
certain
variability
of
plan
How
it
is
possible
to
turn
these
natural
features
to
account
unless
topographical
knowledge
is
supplemented
by
versatility
of
mind
So
the
student
of
war
who
is
unversed
in
the
art
of
war
of
varying
his
plans
even
though
he
be
acquainted
with
the
Five
Advantages
will
fail
to
make
the
best
use
of
his
men
Chia
Lin
tells
us
that
these
imply
five
obvious
and
generally
advantageous
lines
of
action
namely
if
a
certain
road
is
short
it
must
be
followed
if
an
army
is
isolated
it
must
be
attacked
if
a
town
is
in
a
parlous
condition
it
must
be
besieged
if
a
position
can
be
stormed
it
must
be
attempted
and
if
consistent
with
military
operations
the
ruler
s
commands
must
be
obeyed
But
there
are
circumstances
which
sometimes
forbid
a
general
to
use
these
advantages
For
instance
a
certain
road
may
be
the
shortest
way
for
him
but
if
he
knows
that
it
abounds
in
natural
obstacles
or
that
the
enemy
has
laid
an
ambush
on
it
he
will
not
follow
that
road
A
hostile
force
may
be
open
to
attack
but
if
he
knows
that
it
is
hard
pressed
and
likely
to
fight
with
desperation
he
will
refrain
from
striking
and
so
on
Hence
in
the
wise
leader
s
plans
considerations
of
advantage
and
of
disadvantage
will
be
blended
together
Whether
in
an
advantageous
position
or
a
disadvantageous
one
says
Ts
ao
Kung
the
opposite
state
should
be
always
present
to
your
mind
If
our
expectation
of
advantage
be
tempered
in
this
way
we
may
succeed
in
accomplishing
the
essential
part
of
our
schemes
Tu
Mu
says
If
we
wish
to
wrest
an
advantage
from
the
enemy
we
must
not
fix
our
minds
on
that
alone
but
allow
for
the
possibility
of
the
enemy
also
doing
some
harm
to
us
and
let
this
enter
as
a
factor
into
our
calculations
If
on
the
other
hand
in
the
midst
of
difficulties
we
are
always
ready
to
seize
an
advantage
we
may
extricate
ourselves
from
misfortune
Tu
Mu
says
If
I
wish
to
extricate
myself
from
a
dangerous
position
I
must
consider
not
only
the
enemy
s
ability
to
injure
me
but
also
my
own
ability
to
gain
an
advantage
over
the
enemy
If
in
my
counsels
these
two
considerations
are
properly
blended
I
shall
succeed
in
liberating
myself
For
instance
if
I
am
surrounded
by
the
enemy
and
only
think
of
effecting
an
escape
the
nervelessness
of
my
policy
will
incite
my
adversary
to
pursue
and
crush
me
it
would
be
far
better
to
encourage
my
men
to
deliver
a
bold
counter
attack
and
use
the
advantage
thus
gained
to
free
myself
from
the
enemy
s
toils
See
the
story
of
Ts
ao
Ts
ao
VII
note
Reduce
the
hostile
chiefs
by
inflicting
damage
on
them
Chia
Lin
enumerates
several
ways
of
inflicting
this
injury
some
of
which
would
only
occur
to
the
Oriental
mind
Entice
away
the
enemy
s
best
and
wisest
men
so
that
he
may
be
left
without
counselors
Introduce
traitors
into
his
country
that
the
government
policy
may
be
rendered
futile
Foment
intrigue
and
deceit
and
thus
sow
dissension
between
the
ruler
and
his
ministers
By
means
of
every
artful
contrivance
cause
deterioration
amongst
his
men
and
waste
of
his
treasure
Corrupt
his
morals
by
insidious
gifts
leading
him
into
excess
Disturb
and
unsettle
his
mind
by
presenting
him
with
lovely
women
Chang
Yu
after
Wang
Hsi
makes
a
different
interpretation
of
Sun
Tzŭ
here
Get
the
enemy
into
a
position
where
he
must
suffer
injury
and
he
will
submit
of
his
own
accord
and
make
trouble
for
them
Tu
Mu
in
this
phrase
in
his
interpretation
indicates
that
trouble
should
be
made
for
the
enemy
affecting
their
possessions
or
as
we
might
say
assets
which
he
considers
to
be
a
large
army
a
rich
exchequer
harmony
amongst
the
soldiers
punctual
fulfillment
of
commands
These
give
us
a
whip
hand
over
the
enemy
and
keep
them
constantly
engaged
Literally
make
servants
of
them
Tu
Yu
says
prevent
them
from
having
any
rest
hold
out
specious
allurements
and
make
them
rush
to
any
given
point
Meng
Shih
s
note
contains
an
excellent
example
of
the
idiomatic
use
of
cause
them
to
forget
pien
the
reasons
for
acting
otherwise
than
on
their
first
impulse
and
hasten
in
our
direction
The
art
of
war
teaches
us
to
rely
not
on
the
likelihood
of
the
enemy
s
not
coming
but
on
our
own
readiness
to
receive
him
not
on
the
chance
of
his
not
attacking
but
rather
on
the
fact
that
we
have
made
our
position
unassailable
There
are
five
dangerous
faults
which
may
affect
a
general
Recklessness
which
leads
to
destruction
Bravery
without
forethought
as
Ts
ao
Kung
analyzes
it
which
causes
a
man
to
fight
blindly
and
desperately
like
a
mad
bull
Such
an
opponent
says
Chang
Yu
must
not
be
encountered
with
brute
force
but
may
be
lured
into
an
ambush
and
slain
Cf
Wu
Tzŭ
chap
IV
ad
init
In
estimating
the
character
of
a
general
men
are
wont
to
pay
exclusive
attention
to
his
courage
forgetting
that
courage
is
only
one
out
of
many
qualities
which
a
general
should
possess
The
merely
brave
man
is
prone
to
fight
recklessly
and
he
who
fights
recklessly
without
any
perception
of
what
is
expedient
must
be
condemned
Ssu
ma
Fa
too
makes
the
incisive
remark
Simply
going
to
one
s
death
does
not
bring
about
victory
cowardice
which
leads
to
capture
Ts
ao
Kung
defines
the
Chinese
word
translated
here
as
cowardice
as
being
of
the
man
whom
timidity
prevents
from
advancing
to
seize
an
advantage
and
Wang
Hsi
adds
who
is
quick
to
flee
at
the
sight
of
danger
Meng
Shih
gives
the
closer
paraphrase
he
who
is
bent
on
returning
alive
this
is
the
man
who
will
never
take
a
risk
But
as
Sun
Tzŭ
knew
nothing
is
to
be
achieved
in
war
unless
you
are
willing
to
take
risks
T
ai
Kung
said
He
who
lets
an
advantage
slip
will
subsequently
bring
upon
himself
real
disaster
In
A
D
Liu
Yu
pursued
the
rebel
Huan
Hsuan
up
the
Yangtsze
and
fought
a
naval
battle
with
him
at
the
island
of
Ch
eng
hung
The
loyal
troops
numbered
only
a
few
thousands
while
their
opponents
were
in
great
force
But
Huan
Hsuan
fearing
the
fate
which
was
in
store
for
him
should
be
be
overcome
had
a
light
boat
made
fast
to
the
side
of
his
war
junk
so
that
he
might
escape
if
necessary
at
a
moment
s
notice
The
natural
result
was
that
the
fighting
spirit
of
his
soldiers
was
utterly
quenched
and
when
the
loyalists
made
an
attack
from
windward
with
fireships
all
striving
with
the
utmost
ardor
to
be
first
in
the
fray
Huan
Hsuan
s
forces
were
routed
had
to
burn
all
their
baggage
and
fled
for
two
days
and
nights
without
stopping
Chang
Yu
tells
a
somewhat
similar
story
of
Chao
Ying
ch
i
a
general
of
the
Chin
State
who
during
a
battle
with
the
army
of
Ch
u
in
B
C
had
a
boat
kept
in
readiness
for
him
on
the
river
wishing
in
case
of
defeat
to
be
the
first
to
get
across
a
hasty
temper
which
can
be
provoked
by
insults
Tu
Mu
tells
us
that
Yao
Hsing
when
opposed
in
A
D
by
Huang
Mei
Teng
Ch
iang
and
others
shut
himself
up
behind
his
walls
and
refused
to
fight
Teng
Ch
iang
said
Our
adversary
is
of
a
choleric
temper
and
easily
provoked
let
us
make
constant
sallies
and
break
down
his
walls
then
he
will
grow
angry
and
come
out
Once
we
can
bring
his
force
to
battle
it
is
doomed
to
be
our
prey
This
plan
was
acted
upon
Yao
Hsiang
came
out
to
fight
was
lured
as
far
as
San
yuan
by
the
enemy
s
pretended
flight
and
finally
attacked
and
slain
a
delicacy
of
honour
which
is
sensitive
to
shame
This
need
not
be
taken
to
mean
that
a
sense
of
honour
is
really
a
defect
in
a
general
What
Sun
Tzŭ
condemns
is
rather
an
exaggerated
sensitiveness
to
slanderous
reports
the
thin
skinned
man
who
is
stung
by
opprobrium
however
undeserved
Mei
Yao
ch
en
truly
observes
though
somewhat
paradoxically
The
seeker
after
glory
should
be
careless
of
public
opinion
over
solicitude
for
his
men
which
exposes
him
to
worry
and
trouble
Here
again
Sun
Tzŭ
does
not
mean
that
the
general
is
to
be
careless
of
the
welfare
of
his
troops
All
he
wishes
to
emphasize
is
the
danger
of
sacrificing
any
important
military
advantage
to
the
immediate
comfort
of
his
men
This
is
a
shortsighted
policy
because
in
the
long
run
the
troops
will
suffer
more
from
the
defeat
or
at
best
the
prolongation
of
the
war
which
will
be
the
consequence
A
mistaken
feeling
of
pity
will
often
induce
a
general
to
relieve
a
beleaguered
city
or
to
reinforce
a
hard
pressed
detachment
contrary
to
his
military
instincts
It
is
now
generally
admitted
that
our
repeated
efforts
to
relieve
Ladysmith
in
the
South
African
War
were
so
many
strategical
blunders
which
defeated
their
own
purpose
And
in
the
end
relief
came
through
the
very
man
who
started
out
with
the
distinct
resolve
no
longer
to
subordinate
the
interests
of
the
whole
to
sentiment
in
favour
of
a
part
An
old
soldier
of
one
of
our
generals
who
failed
most
conspicuously
in
this
war
tried
once
I
remember
to
defend
him
to
me
on
the
ground
that
he
was
always
so
good
to
his
men
By
this
plea
had
he
but
known
it
he
was
only
condemning
him
out
of
Sun
Tzŭ
s
mouth
These
are
the
five
besetting
sins
of
a
general
ruinous
to
the
conduct
of
war
When
an
army
is
overthrown
and
its
leader
slain
the
cause
will
surely
be
found
among
these
five
dangerous
faults
Let
them
be
a
subject
of
meditation

THE
ARMY
ON
THE
MARCH
The
contents
of
this
interesting
chapter
are
better
indicated
in
than
by
this
heading
Sun
Tzŭ
said
We
come
now
to
the
question
of
encamping
the
army
and
observing
signs
of
the
enemy
Pass
quickly
over
mountains
and
keep
in
the
neighbourhood
of
valleys
The
idea
is
not
to
linger
among
barren
uplands
but
to
keep
close
to
supplies
of
water
and
grass
Cf
Wu
Tzŭ
ch
Abide
not
in
natural
ovens
i
e
the
openings
of
valleys
Chang
Yu
tells
the
following
anecdote
Wu
tu
Ch
iang
was
a
robber
captain
in
the
time
of
the
Later
Han
and
Ma
Yuan
was
sent
to
exterminate
his
gang
Ch
iang
having
found
a
refuge
in
the
hills
Ma
Yuan
made
no
attempt
to
force
a
battle
but
seized
all
the
favourable
positions
commanding
supplies
of
water
and
forage
Ch
iang
was
soon
in
such
a
desperate
plight
for
want
of
provisions
that
he
was
forced
to
make
a
total
surrender
He
did
not
know
the
advantage
of
keeping
in
the
neighbourhood
of
valleys
Camp
in
high
places
Not
on
high
hills
but
on
knolls
or
hillocks
elevated
above
the
surrounding
country
facing
the
sun
Tu
Mu
takes
this
to
mean
facing
south
and
Ch
en
Hao
facing
east
Cf
infra
Do
not
climb
heights
in
order
to
fight
So
much
for
mountain
warfare
After
crossing
a
river
you
should
get
far
away
from
it
In
order
to
tempt
the
enemy
to
cross
after
you
according
to
Ts
ao
Kung
and
also
says
Chang
Yu
in
order
not
to
be
impeded
in
your
evolutions
The
T
ung
Tien
reads
If
the
enemy
crosses
a
river
etc
But
in
view
of
the
next
sentence
this
is
almost
certainly
an
interpolation
When
an
invading
force
crosses
a
river
in
its
onward
march
do
not
advance
to
meet
it
in
mid
stream
It
will
be
best
to
let
half
the
army
get
across
and
then
deliver
your
attack
Li
Ch
uan
alludes
to
the
great
victory
won
by
Han
Hsin
over
Lung
Chu
at
the
Wei
River
Turning
to
the
Ch
ien
Han
Shu
ch
fol
verso
we
find
the
battle
described
as
follows
The
two
armies
were
drawn
up
on
opposite
sides
of
the
river
In
the
night
Han
Hsin
ordered
his
men
to
take
some
ten
thousand
sacks
filled
with
sand
and
construct
a
dam
higher
up
Then
leading
half
his
army
across
he
attacked
Lung
Chu
but
after
a
time
pretending
to
have
failed
in
his
attempt
he
hastily
withdrew
to
the
other
bank
Lung
Chu
was
much
elated
by
this
unlooked
for
success
and
exclaiming
I
felt
sure
that
Han
Hsin
was
really
a
coward
he
pursued
him
and
began
crossing
the
river
in
his
turn
Han
Hsin
now
sent
a
party
to
cut
open
the
sandbags
thus
releasing
a
great
volume
of
water
which
swept
down
and
prevented
the
greater
portion
of
Lung
Chu
s
army
from
getting
across
He
then
turned
upon
the
force
which
had
been
cut
off
and
annihilated
it
Lung
Chu
himself
being
amongst
the
slain
The
rest
of
the
army
on
the
further
bank
also
scattered
and
fled
in
all
directions
If
you
are
anxious
to
fight
you
should
not
go
to
meet
the
invader
near
a
river
which
he
has
to
cross
For
fear
of
preventing
his
crossing
Moor
your
craft
higher
up
than
the
enemy
and
facing
the
sun
See
supra
The
repetition
of
these
words
in
connection
with
water
is
very
awkward
Chang
Yu
has
the
note
Said
either
of
troops
marshalled
on
the
river
bank
or
of
boats
anchored
in
the
stream
itself
in
either
case
it
is
essential
to
be
higher
than
the
enemy
and
facing
the
sun
The
other
commentators
are
not
at
all
explicit
Do
not
move
up
stream
to
meet
the
enemy
Tu
Mu
says
As
water
flows
downwards
we
must
not
pitch
our
camp
on
the
lower
reaches
of
a
river
for
fear
the
enemy
should
open
the
sluices
and
sweep
us
away
in
a
flood
Chu
ko
Wu
hou
has
remarked
that
in
river
warfare
we
must
not
advance
against
the
stream
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
our
fleet
must
not
be
anchored
below
that
of
the
enemy
for
then
they
would
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
current
and
make
short
work
of
us
There
is
also
the
danger
noted
by
other
commentators
that
the
enemy
may
throw
poison
on
the
water
to
be
carried
down
to
us
So
much
for
river
warfare
In
crossing
salt
marshes
your
sole
concern
should
be
to
get
over
them
quickly
without
any
delay
Because
of
the
lack
of
fresh
water
the
poor
quality
of
the
herbage
and
last
but
not
least
because
they
are
low
flat
and
exposed
to
attack
If
forced
to
fight
in
a
salt
marsh
you
should
have
water
and
grass
near
you
and
get
your
back
to
a
clump
of
trees
Li
Ch
uan
remarks
that
the
ground
is
less
likely
to
be
treacherous
where
there
are
trees
while
Tu
Mu
says
that
they
will
serve
to
protect
the
rear
So
much
for
operations
in
salt
marshes
In
dry
level
country
take
up
an
easily
accessible
position
with
rising
ground
to
your
right
and
on
your
rear
Tu
Mu
quotes
T
ai
Kung
as
saying
An
army
should
have
a
stream
or
a
marsh
on
its
left
and
a
hill
or
tumulus
on
its
right
so
that
the
danger
may
be
in
front
and
safety
lie
behind
So
much
for
campaigning
in
flat
country
These
are
the
four
useful
branches
of
military
knowledge
Those
namely
concerned
with
mountains
rivers
marshes
and
plains
Compare
Napoleon
s
Military
Maxims
no
which
enabled
the
Yellow
Emperor
to
vanquish
four
several
sovereigns
Regarding
the
Yellow
Emperor
Mei
Yao
ch
en
asks
with
some
plausibility
whether
there
is
an
error
in
the
text
as
nothing
is
known
of
Huang
Ti
having
conquered
four
other
Emperors
The
Shih
Chi
ch
ad
init
speaks
only
of
his
victories
over
Yen
Ti
and
Ch
ih
Yu
In
the
Liu
T
ao
it
is
mentioned
that
he
fought
seventy
battles
and
pacified
the
Empire
Ts
ao
Kung
s
explanation
is
that
the
Yellow
Emperor
was
the
first
to
institute
the
feudal
system
of
vassals
princes
each
of
whom
to
the
number
of
four
originally
bore
the
title
of
Emperor
Li
Ch
uan
tells
us
that
the
art
of
war
originated
under
Huang
Ti
who
received
it
from
his
Minister
Feng
Hou
All
armies
prefer
high
ground
to
low
High
Ground
says
Mei
Yao
ch
en
is
not
only
more
agreeable
and
salubrious
but
more
convenient
from
a
military
point
of
view
low
ground
is
not
only
damp
and
unhealthy
but
also
disadvantageous
for
fighting
and
sunny
places
to
dark
If
you
are
careful
of
your
men
Ts
ao
Kung
says
Make
for
fresh
water
and
pasture
where
you
can
turn
out
your
animals
to
graze
and
camp
on
hard
ground
the
army
will
be
free
from
disease
of
every
kind
Chang
Yu
says
The
dryness
of
the
climate
will
prevent
the
outbreak
of
illness
and
this
will
spell
victory
When
you
come
to
a
hill
or
a
bank
occupy
the
sunny
side
with
the
slope
on
your
right
rear
Thus
you
will
at
once
act
for
the
benefit
of
your
soldiers
and
utilise
the
natural
advantages
of
the
ground
When
in
consequence
of
heavy
rains
up
country
a
river
which
you
wish
to
ford
is
swollen
and
flecked
with
foam
you
must
wait
until
it
subsides
Country
in
which
there
are
precipitous
cliffs
with
torrents
running
between
deep
natural
hollows
The
latter

and
crevasses
Defined
by
Mei
Yao
ch
en
as
a
narrow
difficult
way
between
beetling
cliffs
Tu
Mu
s
note
is
ground
covered
with
trees
and
rocks
and
intersected
by
numerous
ravines
and
pitfalls
This
is
very
vague
but
Chia
Lin
explains
it
clearly
enough
as
a
defile
or
narrow
pass
and
Chang
Yu
takes
much
the
same
view
On
the
whole
the
weight
of
the
commentators
certainly
inclines
to
the
rendering
defile
But
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
Chinese
in
one
place
is
a
crack
or
fissure
and
the
fact
that
the
meaning
of
the
Chinese
elsewhere
in
the
sentence
indicates
something
in
the
nature
of
a
defile
make
me
think
that
Sun
Tzŭ
is
here
speaking
of
crevasses
should
be
left
with
all
possible
speed
and
not
approached
While
we
keep
away
from
such
places
we
should
get
the
enemy
to
approach
them
while
we
face
them
we
should
let
the
enemy
have
them
on
his
rear
If
in
the
neighbourhood
of
your
camp
there
should
be
any
hilly
country
ponds
surrounded
by
aquatic
grass
hollow
basins
filled
with
reeds
or
woods
with
thick
undergrowth
they
must
be
carefully
routed
out
and
searched
for
these
are
places
where
men
in
ambush
or
insidious
spies
are
likely
to
be
lurking
Chang
Yu
has
the
note
We
must
also
be
on
our
guard
against
traitors
who
may
lie
in
close
covert
secretly
spying
out
our
weaknesses
and
overhearing
our
instructions
When
the
enemy
is
close
at
hand
and
remains
quiet
he
is
relying
on
the
natural
strength
of
his
position
Here
begin
Sun
Tzŭ
s
remarks
on
the
reading
of
signs
much
of
which
is
so
good
that
it
could
almost
be
included
in
a
modern
manual
like
Gen
Baden
Powell
s
Aids
to
Scouting
When
he
keeps
aloof
and
tries
to
provoke
a
battle
he
is
anxious
for
the
other
side
to
advance
Probably
because
we
are
in
a
strong
position
from
which
he
wishes
to
dislodge
us
If
he
came
close
up
to
us
says
Tu
Mu
and
tried
to
force
a
battle
he
would
seem
to
despise
us
and
there
would
be
less
probability
of
our
responding
to
the
challenge
If
his
place
of
encampment
is
easy
of
access
he
is
tendering
a
bait
Movement
amongst
the
trees
of
a
forest
shows
that
the
enemy
is
advancing
Ts
ao
Kung
explains
this
as
felling
trees
to
clear
a
passage
and
Chang
Yu
says
Every
man
sends
out
scouts
to
climb
high
places
and
observe
the
enemy
If
a
scout
sees
that
the
trees
of
a
forest
are
moving
and
shaking
he
may
know
that
they
are
being
cut
down
to
clear
a
passage
for
the
enemy
s
march
The
appearance
of
a
number
of
screens
in
the
midst
of
thick
grass
means
that
the
enemy
wants
to
make
us
suspicious
Tu
Yu
s
explanation
borrowed
from
Ts
ao
Kung
s
is
as
follows
The
presence
of
a
number
of
screens
or
sheds
in
the
midst
of
thick
vegetation
is
a
sure
sign
that
the
enemy
has
fled
and
fearing
pursuit
has
constructed
these
hiding
places
in
order
to
make
us
suspect
an
ambush
It
appears
that
these
screens
were
hastily
knotted
together
out
of
any
long
grass
which
the
retreating
enemy
happened
to
come
across
The
rising
of
birds
in
their
flight
is
the
sign
of
an
ambuscade
Chang
Yu
s
explanation
is
doubtless
right
When
birds
that
are
flying
along
in
a
straight
line
suddenly
shoot
upwards
it
means
that
soldiers
are
in
ambush
at
the
spot
beneath
Startled
beasts
indicate
that
a
sudden
attack
is
coming
When
there
is
dust
rising
in
a
high
column
it
is
the
sign
of
chariots
advancing
when
the
dust
is
low
but
spread
over
a
wide
area
it
betokens
the
approach
of
infantry
High
and
sharp
or
rising
to
a
peak
is
of
course
somewhat
exaggerated
as
applied
to
dust
The
commentators
explain
the
phenomenon
by
saying
that
horses
and
chariots
being
heavier
than
men
raise
more
dust
and
also
follow
one
another
in
the
same
wheel
track
whereas
foot
soldiers
would
be
marching
in
ranks
many
abreast
According
to
Chang
Yu
every
army
on
the
march
must
have
scouts
some
way
in
advance
who
on
sighting
dust
raised
by
the
enemy
will
gallop
back
and
report
it
to
the
commander
in
chief
Cf
Gen
Baden
Powell
As
you
move
along
say
in
a
hostile
country
your
eyes
should
be
looking
afar
for
the
enemy
or
any
signs
of
him
figures
dust
rising
birds
getting
up
glitter
of
arms
etc
When
it
branches
out
in
different
directions
it
shows
that
parties
have
been
sent
to
collect
firewood
A
few
clouds
of
dust
moving
to
and
fro
signify
that
the
army
is
encamping
Chang
Yu
says
In
apportioning
the
defences
for
a
cantonment
light
horse
will
be
sent
out
to
survey
the
position
and
ascertain
the
weak
and
strong
points
all
along
its
circumference
Hence
the
small
quantity
of
dust
and
its
motion
Humble
words
and
increased
preparations
are
signs
that
the
enemy
is
about
to
advance
As
though
they
stood
in
great
fear
of
us
says
Tu
Mu
Their
object
is
to
make
us
contemptuous
and
careless
after
which
they
will
attack
us
Chang
Yu
alludes
to
the
story
of
T
ien
Tan
of
the
Ch
i
mo
against
the
Yen
forces
led
by
Ch
i
Chieh
In
ch
of
the
Shih
Chi
we
read
T
ien
Tan
openly
said
My
only
fear
is
that
the
Yen
army
may
cut
off
the
noses
of
their
Ch
i
prisoners
and
place
them
in
the
front
rank
to
fight
against
us
that
would
be
the
undoing
of
our
city
The
other
side
being
informed
of
this
speech
at
once
acted
on
the
suggestion
but
those
within
the
city
were
enraged
at
seeing
their
fellow
countrymen
thus
mutilated
and
fearing
only
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
enemy
s
hands
were
nerved
to
defend
themselves
more
obstinately
than
ever
Once
again
T
ien
Tan
sent
back
converted
spies
who
reported
these
words
to
the
enemy
What
I
dread
most
is
that
the
men
of
Yen
may
dig
up
the
ancestral
tombs
outside
the
town
and
by
inflicting
this
indignity
on
our
forefathers
cause
us
to
become
faint
hearted
Forthwith
the
besiegers
dug
up
all
the
graves
and
burned
the
corpses
lying
in
them
And
the
inhabitants
of
Chi
mo
witnessing
the
outrage
from
the
city
walls
wept
passionately
and
were
all
impatient
to
go
out
and
fight
their
fury
being
increased
tenfold
T
ien
Tan
knew
then
that
his
soldiers
were
ready
for
any
enterprise
But
instead
of
a
sword
he
himself
took
a
mattock
in
his
hands
and
ordered
others
to
be
distributed
amongst
his
best
warriors
while
the
ranks
were
filled
up
with
their
wives
and
concubines
He
then
served
out
all
the
remaining
rations
and
bade
his
men
eat
their
fill
The
regular
soldiers
were
told
to
keep
out
of
sight
and
the
walls
were
manned
with
the
old
and
weaker
men
and
with
women
This
done
envoys
were
dispatched
to
the
enemy
s
camp
to
arrange
terms
of
surrender
whereupon
the
Yen
army
began
shouting
for
joy
T
ien
Tan
also
collected
ounces
of
silver
from
the
people
and
got
the
wealthy
citizens
of
Chi
mo
to
send
it
to
the
Yen
general
with
the
prayer
that
when
the
town
capitulated
he
would
not
allow
their
homes
to
be
plundered
or
their
women
to
be
maltreated
Ch
i
Chieh
in
high
good
humor
granted
their
prayer
but
his
army
now
became
increasingly
slack
and
careless
Meanwhile
T
ien
Tan
got
together
a
thousand
oxen
decked
them
with
pieces
of
red
silk
painted
their
bodies
dragon
like
with
colored
stripes
and
fastened
sharp
blades
on
their
horns
and
well
greased
rushes
on
their
tails
When
night
came
on
he
lighted
the
ends
of
the
rushes
and
drove
the
oxen
through
a
number
of
holes
which
he
had
pierced
in
the
walls
backing
them
up
with
a
force
of
picked
warriors
The
animals
maddened
with
pain
dashed
furiously
into
the
enemy
s
camp
where
they
caused
the
utmost
confusion
and
dismay
for
their
tails
acted
as
torches
showing
up
the
hideous
pattern
on
their
bodies
and
the
weapons
on
their
horns
killed
or
wounded
any
with
whom
they
came
into
contact
In
the
meantime
the
band
of
had
crept
up
with
gags
in
their
mouths
and
now
threw
themselves
on
the
enemy
At
the
same
moment
a
frightful
din
arose
in
the
city
itself
all
those
that
remained
behind
making
as
much
noise
as
possible
by
banging
drums
and
hammering
on
bronze
vessels
until
heaven
and
earth
were
convulsed
by
the
uproar
Terror
stricken
the
Yen
army
fled
in
disorder
hotly
pursued
by
the
men
of
Ch
i
who
succeeded
in
slaying
their
general
Ch
i
Chien
The
result
of
the
battle
was
the
ultimate
recovery
of
some
seventy
cities
which
had
belonged
to
the
Ch
i
State
Violent
language
and
driving
forward
as
if
to
the
attack
are
signs
that
he
will
retreat
When
the
light
chariots
come
out
first
and
take
up
a
position
on
the
wings
it
is
a
sign
that
the
enemy
is
forming
for
battle
Peace
proposals
unaccompanied
by
a
sworn
covenant
indicate
a
plot
The
reading
here
is
uncertain
Li
Ch
uan
indicates
a
treaty
confirmed
by
oaths
and
hostages
Wang
Hsi
and
Chang
Yu
on
the
other
hand
simply
say
without
reason
on
a
frivolous
pretext
When
there
is
much
running
about
Every
man
hastening
to
his
proper
place
under
his
own
regimental
banner
and
the
soldiers
fall
into
rank
it
means
that
the
critical
moment
has
come
